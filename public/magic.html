            <p>
                In strict opposition to the folly of their 2016 offseason, the Magic were much more prudent and patient in 2017. They knew they would be bad, and owned it. Bad free agent signings from the 2016 offseason (Serge Ibaka and Jeff Green) are gone, but bad free agent signing from the 2016 offseason Bismack Biyombo will be around for a couple more years. Nothing so bad exists from last year's offseason, simply because the Magic didn't spend money (the largest outlay was 3 years and $20M to Jonathan Simmons, hardly a back breaker of a deal).
            </p>
            <p>
                With what will be at least a top 6 pick in the 2018 draft to go along with last year's #6 pick Johnathan Isaac, the Magic are hoping to build a winner the slow, old-fashioned way. They do have one potential big contract to worry about this off-season: Aaron Gordon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gordon was ill-suited for the wing role that the Magic stuffed him into when they added Biyombo and Ibaka in 2016. He couldn't shoot and wasn't adept at defending other team's small forwards. With Ibaka gone and Biyombo's role reduced, Gordon could move back to the 4 where his game fits much better. He even showed a marked improvement in shooting from beyond the arc (33.6%, while still not good, at least provides some hope he can get to at least league average after three seasons under 30%). He has bouncy athleticism on offense, but still needs to put the whole package together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gordon is a Restricted Free Agent, so Orlando doesn't have to be proactive about re-signing him if they don't want to. He will be one of the few players that could draw interest in free agency, but with so few teams that will have enough space available, the Magic might not be required to offer anything above market value to keep him. As he's one of the young players they still hope to build this team around, they should be able and interested in keeping him.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the draft, Orlando should prioritize a point guard. They have young players at the 2, 3 and 4 (Evan Fournier, Isaac, Gordon) and only have what should be reserve players at the point now in D.J. Augustin and Shelvin Mack. Elfrid Payton, who was to be that future at the point, never panned out for the Magic and they gave up on him, giving him to Phoenix for what will end up a decent 2nd round pick. Although the Magic have Nicolas Vucevic and Bismack Biyombo, they need a center that will fit in the modern NBA, but shouldn't focus on that above getting a point guard. It's easier to find decent centers than good point guards, and good point guards are more valuable. Fournier doesn't have the ball-handling skills to be that kind of James Harden, shooting-guard that plays point-guard, type of player. If a point guard doesn't make sense at their selection, another good wing couldn't hurt. As Boston has shown, you can never have enough of them.

                One small decision will be whether or not to bring back Mario Hezonja. After looking like he wasn't terribly interested in being good, Hezonja had a decently promising season. Orlando might have already decided to be done with him, but if not they could bring him back for relatively cheap.

                Staying away from expensive free agents will again be the best play for Orlando until their young players start to show improvement and they can add pieces around them. Until then, the Magic should stay the course, make minor deals and keep learning.
