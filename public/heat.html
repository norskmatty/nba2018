                The Heat struck out on big ticket free agents last season and so went all-in on their current group, which finished the season in 2016-17 well. They added Kelly Olynyk, drafted Bam Adebayo, and had a good team. Dwayne Wade even rejoined at the trade deadline after finding that his reunion with LeBron is Cleveland wasn't suited to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                But they finished sixth in the east and were summarily dispatched by the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round. Meanwhile, Hassan Whiteside groused about his role on the team and in the offense and probably led to Miami feeling regretful about giving him his massive contract. That's prehaps especially true as the back end of Tyler Johnson's contract kicks in and he now costs over $19M a year for the next two seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, one of the biggest limiting factors for Miami right now is that they are pretty well tied to this current roster for at least two more seasons. Whiteside, Johnson and Goran Dragic are all signed through 2019. Olynyk, Dion Waiters, James Johnson and Josh Richardson are signed even longer, and all between $10M-$16M per season. Justise Winslow is a free agent after this season, too, so if they want to keep him he'll probably join them as an eight-figure salary player.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding to this team will be difficult, unless Miami is willing to pay the tax. This doesn't seem like a team worth paying the tax for (Miami might be done with that after the years spent paying for LeBron, Wade and Chris Bosh during their time there), but maybe Pat Riley talks them into it for some reason. Even keeping Wayne Ellington, a 30-year-old journeyman shooter, will be difficult for the Heat.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Whiteside's complaints in mind, Miami will probably at least kick the tires on a deal to ship him out. Outside of maybe a weirdly desperate Dallas team, though, it's difficult to see a team that would seriously want to add Whiteside's contract and attitude to get traditional center play that could be pretty easily approximated with a much cheaper player. As far as sweeteners, Miami could trade their 2019 1st round pick after the draft, but can't trade another until 2023 (they owe their 2021 to Phoenix as part of the Dragic trade). They also only have one 2nd round pick from 2018-2024 still in hand (2022, although the 2024 is only conveyed if it is 56-60). They should probably stop trading away draft picks for a while at this point. So Whiteside and the Heat are probably stuck with one another.
            </p>
            <p>
                With no draft picks this year, that means that this team is most likely coming back for another 1, probably 2, go arounds exactly as currently constructed, with only minor additions to the roster that may not even factor in the rotation. They're good enough to make the playoffs but not really good enough to make much noise once there. It's a weird little purgatory and, after watching LeBron take them to the Finals in each of his four seasons, probably disappointing.
