                Last season, the Lakers had one of the better overall drafts in quite some time even if their top pick, #2 overall selection Lonzo Ball, was outdone by a pair of rookies drafted lower (Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell). Kyle Kuzma and even Josh Hart look like useful rotation players at the least. Kuzma was an offensive force, but has defensive weaknesses that might prevent him from ever being a starter level player. Still, this was a great draft for Magic Johnson and company.
            </p>
            <p>
                This offseason, however, will shift the focus from the draft to making the Lakers a contender again. Through midseason trades, the Lakers shedded the dead weight of Timofey Mozgov (one of the worst contracts of the 2016 offseason, an impressive feat considering the number of bad contracts from that offseason) and got off money owed to Jordan Clarkson while only taking back expiring contracts. Only Luol Deng (who is being paid $36.8M the next two years to presumable continue to not play) makes more than Ball's $7M dollars. The Lakers can create the most cap space in the league quite easily by simply renouncing rights to players they don't really want.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, target number 1 is LeBron James. There's been talk for some time that LeBron wants to be in LA, where he can better work on his ever-growing empire outside of basketball. And of course, the Lakers would love to have him. He would instantly make this franchise relevant again, a playoff contender that other players would flock to. The Lakers are very attractive to him in the sense that they not only have room for him, but room to add more players around a very open roster. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Lakers have the ability to even sign both LeBron and Paul George and fill in around them. While that remains unlikely, it is possible, and neither player seems terribly interested in sticking with their current team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, LeBron will choose where he wants to go and there's no guarantee he'll sign up with the Lakers, no matter how they've cleared the decks for him. If he doesn't come to Los Angeles, they could still sign Paul George. They could see if the Spurs will trade them Kawhi Leonard. They could even see if they can wrestle Chris Paul from what seems like a good situation in Houston. It's the Lakers, they think they can do anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obviously, the LeBron option is the best. Without any stars coming, the Lakers would have a bunch of cap room and no one to use it on. Let's hope they do not repeat the mistakes of two years ago and sign some washed up vets to comical contracts. Re-signing Julius Randle would be the most obvious move, although it would limit them if they decided to make a move in 2019. By signing players to one year deals (similar to what they did with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope this past season) they can do that. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If no stars come, surrounding Ball with shooters would help him the most. He's not the driver that Ben Simmons is, but a similarly skilled passer and at least has the potential to develop into a passable shooter himself. As a shooting big, Channing Frye was a nice acquisition for them mid-season (although they weren't necessary trying to win). 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's LeBron or bust, though, for creating a contender this upcoming season, barring huge leaps from Ball and Brandon Ingram. I'm sure Magic has had the LeBron powerpoint ready, although there's probably nothing he can say that can convince LeBron more than what LeBron can convince himself of.
