                The Hawks forced out Mike Budenholzer/Mike Budenholzer was given the release he was looking for. Whatever happened, Budenholzer decided one year of watching tanking, rebuilding basketball was more than enough for him. Stripped of his role as President of Basketball Operations, he demanded to be further stripped of his role of coach. And so he and Atlanta move on.

                There isn't a lot to discuss with this team. It is bad. The hope is that John Collins and Taurean Prince form the beginning of the next good Hawks team. Dennis Schröder and Kent Bazemore probably do not. It's not that they are exactly bad players, but neither should be in the discussion for Best Player on Their Team, which is what is happening with the current Hawks. Schröder hasn't built on his early career promise, and Bazemore is already 28. In fact, Schröder explained to German reporters that he'd really like to leave Atlanta, which the Hawks would probably not be totally opposed to. They would especially not be opposed to it if they pick up a point guard at #3 overall in the draft. The issue is: who wants Schröder? It's a good question.

                If Dewayne Dedmon picks up his option, the Hawks will have him for another season. If not, he moves on. It matters a lot to Dedmon, who flashed corner 3 shooting ability all of a sudden in Atlanta and thus suddenly make himself that much more attractive to contenders. If he returns to Atlanta, he could very well see himself traded to one. If he doesn't, he could sign with one, but for less annually than he would get this next season. Atlanta probably isn't sweating it either way.

                With three first round picks this year, they can fully go in on a youth movement. Sure, the Houston pick is barely worth considering a 'first round' pick, but the Minnesota one at #19 is decent enough, and their own pick ended up #3. It's their newest best chance to get a future superstar and where a lot of the Hawks offseasons will and should be. The top two players are widely considered Luka Doncic and Deandre Ayton, and the Hawks front office will earn their pay by correctly choosing the best player from the rest of the draft class if indeed those players are taken first and second overall.

                With so much cap space, Atlanta could either try to steal a restricted free agent from a competitor (they are usually young enough to make that worthwhile) or sit tight and see if they can't operate as a dumping ground for additional compensation. There isn't currently reason to believe the Hawks will be competitive soon, so continuing to collect picks and taking multiple swings there is their best option (see: the Philadelphia 76ers).

                As for right now, Atlanta fans can take comfort in the fact that the Falcons and the Atlanta MLS team are relevant and worth paying attention to, because the Hawks are going to be less intriguing for a while. Maybe they can get some satisfaction over the fact that at least one of Al Horford and Kyle Korver made the NBA Finals.
