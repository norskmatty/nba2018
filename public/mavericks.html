                The Dallas Mavericks never wanted to commit to the tank, but finally had no choice this past season as their rookie point guard, Dennis Smith, Jr., struggled mightily to begin the season and the rest of their players weren't good enough. Since leaving the Warriors to get paid in Dallas, Harrison Barnes has carried a huge load for the Mavericks and been fine, but not great. Wesley Matthews never showed the promise from his years in Portland and will be a free agent in 2019. Dirk Nowitzki can still shoot the ball but to say he has weaknesses on defense is to say that the Egyptian Pyramids are old. Technically true but masks the depth of the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                So it's a flawed, bad team. But you may have been able to easily guess that if you bothered to take a second and see that Dallas won 24 games last season. "Yep," you would say. "Not exactly the Bill Russell Celtics, this team!" 
            </p>

                Dallas has a great deal of open cap space for this coming season, especially if they decline to re-sign Doug McDermott (maybe) or Nerlens Noel (almost certainly). The Noel situation went really poorly for both sides and both probably just want to move on. And in this current cap situation where Dallas is one of only 7-8 teams with actual, useable cap space in the offseason, it could make sense for them to start flashing that cash around. Their pitch is mainly, "Where else are you going to go?" and maybe a little of, "Rick Carlisle is a good coach." But mostly the first thing.

                A lot of players, however, know that this offseason could be death for free agents and are going to exercise their options if they have them. It's a bad year to be a free agent unless you're LeBron James or Paul George (it's never bad to be them), but also a bad year to be a team looking for a good deal. Everyone is waiting for 2019. Why not Dallas as well?

                Currently, only Smith, Barnes and Dwight Powell are signed past next season (and Barnes and Powell have player options). Their draft picks could be added to this list, and any other players they sign this offseason to multi-year deals. It could be prudent, for example, to sign a player or two for a one-year deal, similar to what Philadelphia handed J.J. Redick or the Lakers did for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Use the cap space in 2018, but leave themselves open for business in what is expected to be a pretty wild 2019 offseason.

                Dallas can't make their team good enough this season. LeBron or any other max contract-type players aren't coming here unless they're Harrison Barnes-level players offered a max. But if Dallas is sitting there in 2019, with Smith and another promising young player they drafted in 2018, with cap space for two max contracts, draft picks to trade as compensation, and open roster spots for those max contract guys to even bring over some cheaper veteran buddies? Plus, if the new guys don't mesh with Barnes, he could be tradeable for further assets. Dallas could make themselves an attractive place to build a super team simply by being as much of a blank slate as possible.

                Dallas has swung for the fences repeatedly and mostly whiffed. But all that's left for them to do is keep on trying. That, or hope that Smith, Barnes and the 2018 draft pick are good enough to build around. I'd choose the swing for the fences, myself.
