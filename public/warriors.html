                The Warriors didn't have quite the offseason last year as they did the year before, when they signed Kevin Durant and kicked off two years of 'the Warriors ruined the NBA' whining. They signed Nick Young and Omri Casspi, then paid the Bulls over $3 million to get pick number 38 and draft Jordan Bell. Of the three, Bell was the most useful in the postseason, as Young never fit in (particularly defensively) and Casspi got injured and then waived to make room for former two-way player Quinn Cook. This offseason, barring something completely unexpected like a trade or Kevin Durant leaving in free agency, will be much the same. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Warriors will really want to shore up their bench, but in the cheapest way possible. Kevin Durant declined his player option, making him a free agent and enabling the Warriors to sign him to a lucrative extension. If he wants to, that is. There's a 99% chance he will, because a superstar declining to re-sign with the team he just won two straight championships with is without precedent. But...well, you never know. Once Durant is re-signed, though, the Warriors will have 9 players, with one draft pick to come, and will already be far into the tax. Their two top bench players, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston, are in their mid-30s. Most of their own free agents are some of the vast array of centers this team weirdly collected last season (when their best lineups involve no centers at all). When it comes to the centers, they will have to decide if they want to bring back veterans JaVale McGee (useless against Houston but a positive against Cleveland), David West (not very useful against anyone) and/or Zaza Pachulia (somehow even less useful than West). Kevon Looney, who was somehow the center with the most minutes played in the postseason, is the only young center free agent, and that is because the Warriors declined his option for next season. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Swaggy P is not likely to return, but he got his ring so all's well there. Patrick McCaw is the most likely Warrior free agent to return other than Durant, and they can match an offer any other team makes as he is restricted, but if another team offers way too much (which could be as much as $3-4 million a year) then they'll likely have to pass. With Iguodala then the only bench wing set to return for sure, the Warriors are going to be looking hard for any players that want to join their juggernaut for perhaps less than market value. They'll likely find some takers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only other potential but unlikely drama is Klay Thompson's status. Thompson is in the last year of his contract for 2018/2019, and he will probably be expecting a large extension that will pay him much more than the $18.9M he will get in this final season. Draymond Green has two more seasons before he will be looking for a similar type of extension. Both are 28. With Durant and Curry set to make $70-80M a year between them, will the Lacobs be willing to sacrifice some Silicon Valley profits to keep their stars together and pay a luxury tax that could potentially balloon to almost $200M in a few years? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah, probably. But it will hurt. Again, some sort of Thompson (or Green) move seems like it would have been slightly more likely if the Warriors hadn't come from behind to beat the Rockets and go on to win the title. Because they won, the organizational desire to keep everything the same will be stronger. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So the Warriors are going to bring back their superteam for another season, and fill in around them. With the advancing age and fatigue plaguing them in the regular season, at least, they'll be very interested in any and all players that can play from the 1-3 positions to at the least soak up regular season minutes. There are a lot of regular season minutes, and this season the Warriors proved that the majority of those minutes do not mean a hell of a lot to them. That they barely cared for most of the season and won anyway is not going to make them more interested in the regular season next year.

                But if, somehow, Kevin Durant leaves in free agency...well now that's interesting.
