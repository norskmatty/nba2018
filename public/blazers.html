                Portland came into the season with no championship expectations (well, no realistic ones anyway), one obvious star and hoping to simply make the playoffs in a tough Western Conference...and then end up feeling very disappointed in the results of a 49 win season and the 3 seed. But that is how Portland feels following a dispiriting destruction at the hands of Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the second straight playoff sweep for this team. Last year was at the hands of the full-strength Warriors, which you can be upset about but mostly just have to accept. But this year's sweep appears to have created some existential crises in the heads of Portland's fans, if not the organization. Dame Time is about to reach its peak, and the team around him looks like it is not remotely going to be enough to get this team into championship contention while Lillard sits at the crest of his prime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Portland is still paying the price for it's frenzied, fever-dream spending spree in the 2016 offseason. Allen Crabbe, who was re-signed as a restricted free agent by matching the Brooklyn offer sheet, completed his destiny to become a Net when he was parachuted into Brooklyn in order to allow Portland to dodge the luxury tax this season. Evan Turner's albatross of a contract remains an anchor on this team, both because he costs so much and then because he has to play despite offering little of value to this team. Giving Meyers Leonard $10+ million a year for 4 years has proven to have been a bad bet as Leonard played himself out of the rotation. Moe Harkless costs about as much as Leonard, but at least that contract isn't bad. He's a useful part of their best lineups.
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as many Trailblazer fans would like to, Portland probably can't dump all these remaining contracts, especially the Turner deal. How many draft picks would a team need to take on that contract with its two years left? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, and of interest to Paul Allen? This team is going to be in the luxury tax unless they refuse to re-sign any free agent and just fill the roster with minimum contracts and their first round pick. Paying the luxury tax for this team, even with Paul Allen's deep pockets, makes very little sense. They can probably avoid it with a prudent deal for Nurkic and somehow dropping Leonard or Turner on someone. It also means losing Ed Davis, who was useful off the bench, and also bringing back the same basic team once again.

                Speaking of Nurkic, he's the biggest decision of the offseason for the Blazers. They can play hardball with him, as he's a Restricted Free Agent and this is a bad offseason to be an RFA big man. Hardly any teams have cap space, and those that do might not have a lot of interest in a player like Nurkic, especially since he'll eat that cap space while the Blazers decide if they want to match. The Blazers have Nurkic kind of over a barrel, so if Nurkic thought he'd get signifcant money this offseason he may be disappointed.

                Bringing back Nurkic and running back the same team doesn't seem palatable anymore. This is still a young team but barring a home run draft pick in 2018 and a massive leap from Zach Collins (possible!) can they be good enough to succeed in the playoffs? There's rumors that Terry Stotts will be the fall man, but firing the coach that gets this team to out-perfrom expectations in the regular season on a consistent basis seems like the wrong move. Harkless and Aminu are good players, but don't help the offense in the playoffs with their limitations, a problem exacerbated by Nurkic clogging the lane. It's too easy to load the defense toward Lillard and watch as the other Blazers can't make their opponent pay.

                But if you can't trade the bad players to get better, and you don't have cap space to take additional players on for future draft picks, what's left to change this team? Well, it's breaking up the Lillard/McCollum backcourt duo. It's always tough to recommend trading one of your two best players in an effort to get better, because it's hard to get good value that way. But the two guards can be weak points on defense, and both have under performed during the playoffs. It could a case of just doing something to do something, and absolutely has the potential to backfire (particularly if they trade Lillard). If they do trade one, the obvious need would be a wing player with scoring ability as well as able to hang on defense, but that's the one position in the shortest supply so, uh, good luck.

                I don't think they'll trade either. The most likely path for them is to simply run it back for another season and then see if they have better odds in 2019 to drop a contract or two. That's the safest way to go, one that probably gets them another playoff appearance next season. Probably. And playoff appearances are good, even if you don't win in them often.
