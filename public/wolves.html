                The Timberwolves came into the season with a lot of promise and honestly, they mostly delivered. Adding Jimmy Butler made them better, and they slipped into the playoffs by winning the final game of the season against Denver despite losing Butler for 23 games to injury. Simply making the postseason is a yearly assumption for some teams but Minnesota hadn't accomplished it in 14 years. They managed to look competitive in their series against Houston, but still lost 4-1 in very expected fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coach Tom Thibodeau was supposedly to being defensive intensity to Minnesota, but even after adding Butler that hasn't come to pass. Minnesota instead won thanks to their offense, a surprising fourth overall in net rating, while their defense once again languished in the bottom third of the league (22nd). Thibs might be a good defensive coach, and his Bulls teams were legitimately good there, but this team can't get it done on that end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their offensive success, then, was just enough to squeeze them into the playoffs. It was done despite going against the current three point shooting trends, as Minnesota finished dead last in threes attempted per game (22.3) and 19th in percentage of makes on those few attempts (35.7%). 
            </p>
            <p>
                There is one thing about that, though. Their two best shooters, by far, where Towns and Nemanja Bjelica, both of whom hit more than 41.5% of their attempts and finished in the top 20 of qualified shooters. No other team could boast a frontcourt with two such capable shooters while also fielding a guard/wing rotation where no one made their attempts at even a league average rate. Even so, they can both provide spacing (when Towns isn't down in the post being one of the NBA's few legitimately almost impossible to stop post players) and open lanes for drives to the basket and even open mid-range jumpers. It was enough to work for the Timberwolves, and hard to argue with the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what they can do now to continue to improve? Just making the playoffs was a good organizational goal for 2017/18, since they hadn't done it for so long. But they assuredly want to grow on that. Like so many teams, they have absolutely no cap space (in fact, re-signing Bjelica or Derrick Rose at even backup money puts them into the luxury tax, and they'll still need to fill out 5 more roster spots). Taj Gibson's contract is in it's final season and possibly tradable to a team interested in getting more cap space for what could be a more wide open 2019 offseason, but Gorgui Dieng and Andrew Wiggins will cost about $40 million combined for the next three seasons (uh, yikes). Oh, and Towns will need an extension following the 2018/19 season and he would expect the max. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Timberwolves simply have to get better at defense, even to the 13-17 overall range, to really be a threat in the playoffs. Playing Derrick Rose more isn't a good answer for that, although if Towns never gets better it might be very difficult with or without Rose. With what they can afford, a defensive upgrade of that magnitude would probably negatively impact their offense. Wiggins and Towns are still young enough that improvement from them on the defensive end is still possible, but the hope is starting to fade. If they don't, the Timberwolves will have to maintain a 4th overall offense just to stay afloat.
            </p>
