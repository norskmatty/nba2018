                Memphis took a huge risk two years ago by signing Chandler Parsons to a huge contract (only 2 years and $49.2M left) and Mike Conley to an even bigger one (3 years, $97.5M left if he picks up the player option on the final year, which he very likely will). As sometimes happens when you take risks, you get burned. Memphis caught on fire.
            </p>
            <p>
                The moves were defensable at the time. The Conley contract might even still be, even if Conley missed the past season with an injury. Parsons had a known knee issue and was available to be signed by Memphis in part because of it. He hasn't recovered from it and has played only 70 games total the past two seasons while looking like a shell of his former self. Without Conley and with a gimpy Parsons and a declining Marc Gasol, the former Grit-and-Grind Grizzlies were ground down to the nub.
            </p>
            <p>
                Memphis has the second best odds at the number one pick in the draft. They can start working toward that future as they see out the end of these contracts. It could very well be a long, protracted process. Gasol didn't have a good time last year during Memphis' lousy season (it might be hard to remember but the Grizzlies were considered before the season to be playoff contenders in the West). But he's going to be a tough trade with one year left plus a player option (at $25.6M) on a second year that he's extremely likely to pick up at the age of 34. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's certainly possible that Conley comes back next season, Gasol staves off further decline, and they re-sign revelation Tyreke Evans and watch him fit in with Conley and this team still looks decent enough next season. He'll be 30 next year, so maybe he'll never be the same, but the Conley from 2015-2017 was a legitimate star player. They have to give up their draft pick if it's not in the top 8 next season, so maybe they don't want to be be too good (they'll have to give up it eventually, as it's protected 1-6 in 2020 and then unprotected entirely in 2021 when they might actually be a lot worse with an old Conley and everyone else off the books, so giving it up in the next draft after one last hurrah might be for the best).

                As the team is already over the salary cap before drafting a player and re-signing anyone, it's doubtful they'll make any big moves this offseason. They committed to seeing out the Conley/Gasol era, and that's what they really have no other option but to do. That duo has meant a lot to Memphis and were a part of a few very good teams, but the time where Memphis is a team you worry about seeing in the playoffs is almost certainly over.
