                Boston made the Eastern Conference Finals and lost to LeBron and the Cavaliers for the second straight year, but this was a much different feeling than last year. Much of the team was turned over from the year prior, for one. For two, they took the Cavs to a hard-fought seven games and fell just short even though their two best players, Kyrie Irving and Gordan Hayward were missing and had been all playoffs. The future is incandescantly bright for the Celtics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Celtics have a problem that very few teams ever have: they have too many good players. One of the biggest balancing acts for Brad Stevens next year will be managing minutes for all these players and roles for guys like Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, who took on vaguely alpha roles in these playoffs but will now have to step back or at least share a lot with Hayward and Irving. They're also already over the cap and could threaten to just cross the tax line, depending on what they do with their free agents. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With no more Nets picks, Boston only has their own this year in the first round, but could have as many as 4 next season. Two of them, from the Clippers and Memphis, have protections and might not be conveyed, but they will at least get one of the Kings or Sixers picks. Something for them to keep in mind is that they will simply not have room to even roster all these picks if they bring everyone back. 
            </p>

                The biggest decision facing Boston is whether to pay Marcus Smart to bring him back, and then how much. Smart stated after Boston's Game 7 loss that he wanted to make about $12-$15M a year, which is a lot for someone who isn't a starter or crunch-time player if everyone is healthy. (If you don't agree, who of Irving, Hayward, Tatum, Brown, and Al Horford are you leaving out to play Smart?). But he's beloved on the Celtics, a guy who puts his heart into the team and plays with reckless abandon. How could Boston give him up?

                You must have already forgotten about Isaiah Thomas. So have all the Boston fans! Boston is run by cut-throats. Intelligent and analytical cut-throats. Marcus Smart may feel like the heart and soul of this Celtics team, but if Danny Ainge thinks he can make the team better he'll trade Smart to Siberia (or, worse, Sacramento) and he won't even hesitate. The fans who love Smart now will forget all about him come playoff time next season. The Celtics are savvy enough to know this. They may even re-sign him with the intention of making him a part of some future blockbuster trade.

                Greg Monroe was added after Monroe was traded out of Milwaukee and bought out by Phoenix, but he wasn't of much use to Boston in the playoffs. Daniel Theis, a non-guaranteed player who should be back, was injured during the playoffs but may have taken most of the mere 9 minutes per game that Monroe got. The player who played essentially all of the center minutes that Al Horford did not, Aron Baynes, proved to be a useful player, if limited. Now 31, Baynes shouldn't be relied upon but figures to be inexpensive enough to retain.

                It seems most likely that the Celtics will have a very quiet offseason. Bring back Smart, Baynes, and the minimum team option players Abdel Nader, Semi Ojeleye and Daniel Theis. Re-integrate Irving and Hayward with the rest of this suddenly stacked roster and see how it all looks. Play lineups with Tatum or Brown at center or Marcus Morris at the 3 with Horford and Baynes. Get weird! Use the first part of next season to figure out who would really be a part of an 8 or 9 man playoff rotation. Then figure out how to leverage the rest of the roster and draft capital into one more big trade to really make this a championship team. But this offseason...this offseason is the quiet before the storm.
