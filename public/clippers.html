                What a difference a few months makes. In July, the Clippers convinced Blake Griffin to sign a max contract with a pitch involving his jersey in the rafters and art that put him on the level of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Gandhi. Even they ended up thinking that was way too over the top and ridiculous because they turned around and traded him to the Pistons in January even as they were in the running for a playoff spot. Gandhi would never have been traded, I'm just saying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Someone must have shown Steve Ballmer what his tax situation could look like the next five years with Griffin's gigantic contract hanging around for a team that, with Chris Paul forcing his way out, wasn't a championship contender. The team was still feisty after Griffin left, led in large part by a fantastic season from 6th Man of the Year shoe-in Lou Williams and functional play by a host of contributors including Tobias Harris (received in the Griffin trade), Milos Teodosic (when healthy), Sindarius Thornwell and even Boban Marjanovic (also from the Griffin trade). 
            </p>
            <p>
                After missing the playoffs by just a few games, though, the question is where to go from here. Only five players, Danilo Gallinari, Lou Williams, Thornwell, C.J. Williams and Juwan Evans (club option), are signed past next season. If everyone picks up their player options for next season, and it's hard to see anyone not want to do that with this season set to feature very little cap space for free agents, the Clippers will have to make some decisions. Do they want to run this team back for another year, looking at a max potential of a first round playoff exit, or do they want to start what's looking like a very necessary rebuild?
            </p>
            <p>
                The most obvious candidate to be traded is DeAndre Jordan. Locked in his house away from a forlorn Mark Cuban to sign his current deal, if he picks up his option he becomes potentially tradeable as either a useful defensive center for a contender or simply an expiring contract. The Clippers, however, would be unlikely to accept a lot of longer-term salary in return unless it was sweetened with some extra draft capital. Still, if they could get a first-round pick for a big man that relies a lot on athleticism about to turn 30, that would be a win. That's a trade, though, that may wait until the middle of the season before the trade deadline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gallinari is probably rather untradeable. He has struggled with injuries and only played in 21 games last season while having a career worst shooting season. Austin Rivers is the coach's son and won't be traded. Tobias Harris is actually a very attractive player to contenders looking for someone who can play the 3 and the 4, especially if the sudden 3-point shooting surge from the past season is real. Harris shot 41.1% from 3 on 5.6 attempts per game, a significant improvement over his previous career numbers (he had shot 33% in his career on a much smaller volume up until last year). Even if he hovers near 37-38%, he would be a useful floor stretcher that can contribute on both ends of the floor in other ways, as well.

                But Harris is also still young enough that if the Clippers don't trade him and instead re-sign him after next season, he could be a part of the next good Clippers team 2-3 years down the road if they make some smart moves and reload quickly. They will have a good amount of cap space in the summer of 2019 if they choose to let some free agents go and not bring back players like Avery Bradley, Rivers, Patrick Beverly, etc. They have two draft picks this year that, barring a lottery miracle, will be selections 12 and 13. Nail even one of those picks and keep space clear for next season to cycle out some of these older players and the Clippers could be a playoff team again sooner rather than later.
