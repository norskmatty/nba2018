        To Kevin Durant: It's Okay if You Leave Golden State Now

        <label class="caption right">I know, Kevin, I know. You don't want to listen to me talk about it. Just hear me out. </label>
        <p>
            First, this is for Kevin Durant, and Kevin Durant alone. If you aren't Kevin Durant, i.e. you are not seven feet of shot-making talent capable of winning MVPs and championships, please stop reading.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, it should be just you and me now, Mr. Durant. Can I call you Kevin? Great. You may be surprised to hear this, but it is in fact okay if you leave the Golden State Warriors after just two seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can almost hear the surprised expression on your face as you read that last paragraph. Even LeBron stays four years before he leaves, right? Well, that doesn't matter at all. It's your choice, no matter what anyone says. I nor anyone else should or will take your agency away. You're a superstar and you get to choose your destination. That's what led you to join the Warriors two off-seasons ago, because you wanted to win championships. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And you did. You won two in two years, in fact, the most you can get in that period of time. It was, all told, a great move. But maybe, just maybe, it feels...incomplete. On the surface, that sounds insane. What else could you do, besides win championships? The answer is complicated, though, isn't it? Winning championships is great, for sure. But do these championships really feel like the validation you are looking for? These championships aren't 'Kevin Durant won two championships!' They are 'Kevin Durant joined the Warriors and they won two championships.' The difference is subtle, but it's there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, leaving when there are more championships to win seems like a bad move. Let me lie out the case for why it would not be.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> You could win a championship elsewhere. </b> In fact, your legacy still demands it. Sure, you won Finals MVP the first season with the Warriors. You've been the leading scorer in both postseasons with the Warriors. You are very important to these last two championship teams. And yet, what will people remember? You joined a team that had already been to back-to-back NBA Finals, and had won it once. You will always have one fewer ring than Stephen Curry. If you want people to say you are one of the greatest players of all-time, not just of your era, you are going to have to win at least one championship that Curry and Klay Thompson and Draymond Green do not. And you cannot do that on the Warriors.
        </p>
        <p> 
        <img src="/nba2018/public/images/durantwestbrook.jpg" class="image left"> </img>
        <label class="caption left">You got the ball enough playing with this guy to win an MVP, which only looks more improbable with time. </label>
            <b> You'll never win another MVP in Golden State. </b> You have the one, which you won while playing with Russell Westbrook. I think, looking back, we'll be extremely impressed by that. But there is no way anyone is giving you more than token MVP votes while you and the rest of the Warriors play together, even if you decide to put some effort into the regular season. Which, by the way, you and the team seem now to be exceedingly bored by. It's a long season to grind through without finding much of a point to the whole thing. Anyway, that one MVP trophy better be enough for you if you plan on staying in Golden State through the rest of your prime, because there are no more coming. You'll have to watch the James Hardens of the league win them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> You did what you came to do. </b> You wanted championships, and you got them. Shockingly easily, I might add, considering you couldn't quite manage to get one despite real opportunities in Oklahoma City. But the mission has been fulfilled. Just like Oklahoma City, you don't owe anyone in Golden State anything. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> You better get out while the going is good. </b> Look, you and the Warriors are the title favorites again next year, easily. Being on a team with three other All-Stars is great, but what happens when the Lacobs decide that they don't, in fact, want to pay the mind-boggling luxury tax they will end up having to pay to keep this team together when Draymond and Klay need new contracts? Look, the Lacobs say the right things, but ultimately rich people did not get rich by giving their money away. There's a very high possibility that at least one of those two is gone soon. Maybe even after next season. And then what? There's no way for the franchise to sign any free agent of consequence. They have nothing to offer in trades. Meanwhile, even if they all stay, how good do you think Curry will age? Or Draymond? Or Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston? Who is picking up the slack if they fall off even a bit? You, that's who. You still won't get MVPs or anything like that, but you'll be expected to carry the others if they falter. And when you do, people will still say that you couldn't have done it without them. If you don't, and the team loses like it very nearly did to Houston this past season, you'll never hear the end of how you didn't win a championship despite your stacked team.
        </p>
        <p>
            It will get tiring after a while, championships or not.

            You might notice that a lot of these reasons for leaving are for selfish, personal reasons. Of course they are! This is about you, after all, which brings us to our last point. One you might pretend to not care about, one that rarely gets talked about, but which has to be something you at least think about sometimes. <b> You'll never be Golden State's favorite player. </b> You won't. You can go out and play great defense on tough wing players, lead your team in scoring with efficient night after efficient night, but you always know that you won't. Because Stephen Curry is going to run around, make a few threes, and get a lion's share of the credit even while the other team tries to beat you mainly by relentlessly hunting him down when they have the ball, because he is often your team's worst defender. We can debate whether that is fair or not, but the fact of the matter is that the Oracle crowd will always cheer just a bit louder for him, will always go more ballistic for his dagger shots and game-winners, will always root slightly more for him. He was there first, he was there since his rookie season, and they will always love him. They are grateful you came along, sure, but it's not the same and never will be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can understand if the adoration of the crowd is low on your list of priorities. But you've never been the obvious star on your team, no matter how good you've been. You always had Westbrook, and now you have Curry. Your third team might be the place where you are clearly the star, the obvious alpha that the fans get behind, the one that completely drives their marketing. It might not matter, but wouldn't it be interesting to see what that feels like?
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, look, everyone who likes the NBA will just be more than a little relieved if you do leave. This probably means nothing to you, but everyone promises to like you more if you break up this Warriors super team just so there's a little more drama. I'll talk to some people, maybe we can work out a deal where everyone promises not to bring up the burner account thing anymore, that sound fair?
        </p>
        <p>
            So that's my case. Like I said earlier, the decision is completely yours to make and we'll accept whatever you do decide to do. Just consider these thoughts. And not to steer you to any particular team or anything, but I hear the Process is going really well in Philadelphia.
