                Brooklyn has been paying for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett for so long, both of them are now on TV not talking about the Nets because the Nets are bad. This year, their final pick from that deal gets sent out to Boston (and immediately re-routed to Cleveland) and they can finally move on starting with the 2019 draft.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopelessly devoid of talent and draft pick poor, the Nets have spent the last calendar year offering up their cap space as a sponge for teams looking to clear their own space, trying to get a little something for their trouble. They took Allen Crabbe from Portland, and got...Allen Crabbe (Brooklyn has a weird love for Allen Crabbe, he's signed to the contract they offered him in restricted free agency two offseasons ago). They took on Timofey Mozgov's anchor of a contract from the Lakers in order to also get D'Angelo Russell. They took DeMarre Carroll from the Raptors for a first round pick (the Raptors ended up really good and that pick is the 29th selection because nothing ever works out for the Nets) and a 2nd round pick. They even took Jahlil Okafor and Nik Stauskas from Philadelphia for a second round pick.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing they learned was why Philadelphia stopped playing Okafor. Another thing they learned was why the Lakers were perfectly fine with dropping Russell after drafting Lonzo Ball. Also Crabbe and Carroll are fine players but less good when they set career highs for usage. Even though they had nothing to gain by tanking and were trying to win every game, they still ended up in the middle of the Tankapolooza.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now they look ready to drop Okafor and Stauskas and still have just enough space to maybe take on a smaller contract, either as a salary dump or as a second chance home for a fallen star like Russell or Okafor. They were decent moves to try to see if their original teams had made a mistake. Russell is going to be around for another year, he's still only 22. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Winning on the margins is about all they can do until they start getting to make some high picks in the draft due to a team of their talent-poor status. Taking chances on fliers like Spencer Dinwiddie (who is fun!) can at the very least pass the time while they watch the last of the picks they traded away in 2013 get used. They can trade for more Okafors while considering the absurdity of having Deron Williams cost almost $5.5M in dead cap space for two more seasons (he hasn't played for them since the 2014-2015 season). It's not really fun to be the Nets, but it is a challenge, and that's something.
