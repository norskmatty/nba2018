                Without Kawhi Leonard for all but nine games this season, the Spurs acquitted themselves well enough, making the playoffs and even winning a game in a series against the Warriors. Dejounte Murray ascended to the starting lineup ahead of franchise icon Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili still had something left in the tank as he turned 40, and the good ship Spurs went on without incide...
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, okay. What has been such a drama-free, tight-buttoned franchise for so long under Greg Popovich turned in a minor soap opera plot with Leonard's injury leading to friction between player and team. The issue seems to be that the Spurs think he had one injury, and Leonard went and saw another doctor who made a different diagnosis. And now Leonard is estranged from the team, and the rumors are swirling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Spurs can actually offer Leonard the Designated Player Extension, which would pay him more than $200M for five years. No other team can offer anything close to this, and if the Spurs want him to stay and they offer him that, it seems unlikely he'd turn it down. However, if the Spurs are concerned about his injury, concerned about his standing on the team, or simply afraid of laying that much money out on one player, then they might do what would have been unthinkable just one year ago: trade Kawhi Leonard.
            </p>
            <p>
                No offense to Murray or, like, Kyle Anderson, but Kawhi is San Antonio's only really good player under the age of 30. Parker and Ginobili are not long for retirement, even if they can come back for another year or two. LaMarcus Aldridge might be able to make shots out of the post forever, but his effectiveness should wane as he works through his 30's. Pau Gasol is 37, and even Danny Green hit 30. A Kawhi trade would signal that it's time for a rebuild (and perhaps send Popovich to finally join Tim Duncan in retirement himself).
            </p>
            <p>
                So what the Spurs do with Leonard is by far their most important move. If they extend him, bring back Anderson, Davis Bertans and Bryn Forbes, they could be once again among the West's elite. But are they good enough to beat the Warriors or Rockets? Ehhhhh. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's say the Spurs trade Kawhi and start in on a rebuild (let's face it, a Kawhi trade is not going to lead to staying in contention). Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol will get $50-54M each of the next two years (hmm). Aldridge and Mills have an additional year after that. Not very moveable deals, any of them. Beyond that, and, you know, that's a fair amount, there's very little committed salary until it's time to extend Murray. Rudy Gay and Green, if they return on their player options, will be free agents. Parker, even if he re-signs, won't be paid like his last deal. Ginobili is playing for free, basically. Any new young players will get to grow into their own playing with that veteran core, and there are worse things in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be weird to see the Spurs in an actual rebuilding mode. They've made the playoffs basically every season since forever (the franchise going back to the Dallas/Texas Chaparrals days has made the playoffs in an insane 46 of 51 seasons). Kawhi was supposed to keep the train rolling. If the whole thing is botched, though, it's hard to see any other path available to this team.
