        <p>
            On a night when Stephen Curry was as bad as he's ever been shooting the basketball, Kevin Durant picked up the slack with a super efficient 43 points (15-23 from the field and a nice 6-9 from three) to go with 13 rebounds and 7 assists. It felt like every Durant shot was stemming whatever little momentum Cleveland was trying to generate with their own made baskets, but really he was just settling in and hitting basically any jump shot he felt like taking. While Game 2 saw Durant score efficiently mostly by getting to the rim, Game 3 was a return to more of the contested jumper game. The television broadcast pointed out that the Cavaliers were getting hands in his face on his jumpers. But no one really can bother Durant by putting their hands up when he's given space to go up with his shot, he's tall enough that he almost doesn't have to even think about being blocked. He certainly doesn't have to think about being blocked when Kevin Love or Larry Nance, Jr. are jumping at him from three feet away. They aren't blocking his shot, and Durant knows it.

        <p>
            Let's not forget Durant's signature shot from this game and series. You might recall last year, when Durant hit a three pointer from the left-side of the above-the-break three-point line at the end of Game 3 with 45 seconds left that gave Golden State a one-point lead that they would turn into a five-point win. In Game 3 of this year's series, Kevin Durant made a three from nearly the same point on the floor with 49 seconds left. This one turned a three-point Warriors lead into a six-point Warriors lead, effectively ending the game. At first glance, it seemed like he made it from the exact same spot on the floor as last year. WELL ACTUALLY it was about five feet farther back, because when you're with the Warriors you need to increase the level of difficulty to keep yourself interested. Anyway, the Cavaliers' 2018 season's time of death was that exact moment, rest in peace.

            <label class="caption right">Andre Iguodala, who has zero healthy legs at this point, launches for a dunk in one of a thousand Cavaliers defensive breakdowns. </label>
            Andre Iguodala was back for the Warriors after not having played since Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, and even though he only took four shots in 22 minutes, he filled the 'glue guy' role well, +14 for the game. Iguodala hobbled around and at one point it was reported that he injured his right knee (the left being the one that had kept him out for two weeks) but he was the floor for Golden State's final flurry. The Warriors scored 14 points in the final three minutes, including Durant's dagger three and Curry's only made three of his own, and were 5-5 from the field. Included in the middle of that was Iguodala, getting one of the many rolls to the rim that seemed to almost always be available to a Warriors' screener, dunking on Tristan Thompson despite looking like he couldn't walk without a limp before and after.

            Speaking of screening Warriors rolling to the rim, there's a reason that Jordan Bell and JaVale McGee were once again able to combine for unexpected and efficient scoring outputs. Bell had 10 points on 4-5 shooting, and McGee had 10 points on 5-7 shooting. Klay Thompson also had 10 points (on 11 shots) and Curry had just 11 points (including two on end-of-game free throws) during his 3-16 nightmare. Cleveland's inability to properly help on the bigs rolling to the rim while screening for Durant or Curry meant that either McGee/Bell could roll right to the rim for a dunk, or they could dunk after Draymond Green rolled to the rim and drew slightly more attention. Green had nine assists, most of them right at the rim. Even when the Cavaliers switch everything, they can't be nearly as effective defensively as Houston was, because Houston was a smarter team with more ability and, it must be said, effort.

            LeBron had his 10th career Finals triple-double, which is a gaudy number but belies the fact that he wasn't nearly as great in this game. I'm not here to kill LeBron for a 33/10/11 game, but those 33 points came on 28 shots, and he missed many more layups than we have been accustomed to seeing in these playoffs. LeBron landed awkwardly on his right leg in the second quarter, turning the ankle in what looked like it could easily be a sprain. He did not leave the game, of course, and ended up playing 47 of the 48 minutes in the game. And it's impossible to say that the ankle was bothering him in a way that affected his play, although it did seem like he might be purposefully avoiding jumping in a way that would require him to land on it the rest of the game. LeBron was predictably killed for passing too much by the broadcast team, but his passing led to many open shots for Cleveland yet again and his teammates even made him look good by making a lot of their shots early. However, their three-point shooting once again let them down, especially in the second half as their halftime lead evaporated and then never returned.

            But before killing LeBron's teammates too much, it would be a mistake to ignore Rodney Hood's efforts in this game. Hood, who had only played 7 minutes of garbage time the previous seven Cleveland playoff games and seemed rather far from ever seeing a competitive minute again, was actually crucial to Cleveland even being in the game late. In 26 minutes, Hood had 15 points on 7-11 shooting, being aggressive by getting the ball to the hoop for short jumpers and floaters. This was what he was always supposed to be able to do! Playing him was essentially a desperation move by Tyronn Lue, who really had little to lose by playing Hood instead of Jordan Clarkson (Clarkson took Hood's DNP-coach's decision). Everyone who wanted to see Hood get a chance in this series will get to take an annoying victory lap, but it was still nice to see Hood succeed after what has been such a tough playoff experience.

            The Warriors need to win one more game, but at this point the drama in the series has disappeared. Even the Finals MVP drama seems very over, as it's tough to see anyone but Durant getting it again after this game. That might be the only disappointing part for the Curry-leaning Warriors' partisans, but they have little argument after the game Curry had in Game 3. It's about time to fÃªte the Warriors again and focus on the offseason, where everyone will once again try to figure out if they can come up with a team that can challenge them.
