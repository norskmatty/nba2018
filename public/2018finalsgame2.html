            LeBron James had a not nearly enough 29/9/13 line. Kevin Durant had 26/9/7 on a clean 14 attempts. Klay Thompson was similarly efficient, scoring 20 on just 13 shots. JordVale McBell combined for 29 bouncy minutes and 22 points on 8-9 shooting, consistently getting easy looks at the rim. But of course the biggest story from Golden State's 122-103 trouncing of the Cavaliers was Stephen Curry, who had perhaps the greatest game in NBA history from someone who was 2-9 on two-point attempts. His 9-17 three-point game set records for both the most makes and most attempts in an NBA Finals game from beyond the arc. But it wasn't just that he made a disgusting amount of them. As is typical with Curry, every made three felt like a dagger being inserted into your gut, your assailant shimmying away being the last thing you see before the darkness hits.

            This game ended up a blowout, but Cleveland was somehow just close enough in the fourth quarter that the outcome was not at all assured. In fact, the Cavaliers had even slightly closed the 13-point halftime gap by winning the third quarter by three points, only the fourth time this postseason that Golden State had been outscored in the third quarter. In that third quarter, Curry was 0-5 with just one point (on a technical free throw). When LeBron hit a long three to open the scoring in the fourth, the Golden State lead was just seven.

            Curry then hit two threes on back-to-back possessions, both times schooling Larry Nance, Jr. The first was a stepback that completely lost Nance. The second was after a pass to Draymond Green then a hustle to the corner, a move that Curry has pulled numerous times that game and all postseason. Nance was late to react to Curry racing to the corner, and wildly leaped out of the way as Curry calmly let him go by and then hit the three. The two plays were Curry at his best, demonstrating both his all-time great shooting talent as well as the versatility in how he gets his shots. He isn't just a catch-and-shoot sharpshooter, he almost always creates his shots through either his ball-handling or his off-ball movement.

            It was the third three of the quarter that was the most ridiculous, turn off the console because the game is cheating you shot of the game. The possession was completely broken down and Curry was scrambling backwards, well beyond the three-point line as the shot clock expires. He turns around and fades to ensure he can get his shot over Kevin Love, then nearly scrapes the roof with a 30-foot mortar shot that finds nothing but the bottom of the net. This demoralizing rainbow of a shot put the Warriors up by 14 with 7:54 remaining. The Cavs would never get closer than 12 and the Warriors would score 13 of the next 17 points (including two more Steph threes to bring his fourth quarter total to five) to put the game firmly into blowout territory.

            Defensively, the Cavs sprang holes all over the place, especially in transition where they were almost hopeless. Curry raining threes is one thing, but the Warriors shot 70% on two-point attempts even including Curry's 2-9 line from there. Shaun Livingston and Durant basically couldn't miss their mid-range jumpers, but there were very few of those. The Warriors simply got to the rim and scored with little resistance time and time again. It's easy to make 70% of your shots when they are primarily dunks and lay-ups. The Cavaliers have so little rim protection and the Warriors appear to have realized that. Curry, Durant and Green combined for 22 assists, with many of them feeding easy layups inside.

            The Cavaliers, on the other hand, continue to miss open shots. Golden State did a much better job of defending them anyway in Game 2, other than in the first half of the third quarter. Cleveland made 4 of 5 three-point attempts in the first five minutes of the quarter, but were just 5-22 the remainder of the game. Not only were the shots not falling, the Warriors were preventing them from even being attempted. Kyle Korver, who only exists for his shooting, has attempted just four threes in his 33 combined minutes in Games 1 and 2. Kevin Love is 4-16, getting his shots but not making enough. J.R. Smith, Jordan Clarkson and Jeff Green combined for a dismal 5-21 effort (1-6 from 3) in Game 2, which meant that LeBron once again needed to have a superhuman game. His 29 points on 20 shots was, of course, not nearly enough, but watching the Cavaliers brick so many shots it's a wonder he managed to get 13 assists.
        </p>
        <p>
            And it's not clear who Cleveland can play that would lead to a different outcome. Jordan Clarkson has had a nightmare playoffs, especially against Boston and now Golden State, but someone has to handle the ball while George Hill is off the court and Rodney Hood has basically admitted he's not up to the task. Cedi Osman is maybe worth a desperation play, but he's played just 53 minutes this entire postseason and almost none of those in a competitive situation. A just turned 23-year-old rookie, can he just jump in cold against this Warriors team? Again, it might be worth a shot but you're simply hoping he can hit some catch-and-shoot shots no one else has seemed able to while also hoping his deficiencies elsewhere won't hurt you too much. And that's it. There's no one else, unless you have lost your mind and think Jose Calderon or Ante Zizac are answers. They are not the answers to any questions you might ask.

            The series heads to Cleveland now, where the Cavaliers need to win one of two to set up 'the Warriors are up 3-1' jokes or two of two to really have a shot at this series. Stephen Curry is gunning for that elusive NBA Finals MVP trophy that he has missed out on during the Warriors' two previous championships. I suspect that's why he was out there firing up his ninth made three with less than four minutes left after the Cavs had pulled their starters. If Kerr hadn't asked his team to foul right after so he could pull them, he might have tried to see how many he could get. The Warriors are so good that they can screw around against a LeBron team and still win, maybe even in a sweep. The rest of the league had better hope that either Golden State gets tired of paying everyone, or one of the stars gets tired of sharing the attention. Otherwise, we might see at least a couple more years of this.
