                Last year, the Knicks shot out of the gate and acted like they might actually flirt with the playoffs, starting 17-14. Then they dropped the flirting act and went back to video games in the basement, going 12-39 the rest of the way in a truly impressive tank. It was helped by the season-ending injury to Prozingis, who remains discouraged with his franchise for obvious reasons.

                Porzingis is very likely to be unable to return from his torn ACL before the start of the next season, and even if New York had grandiose plans to make moves to return to real contention next season their roster shows the wreckage of previous such grandiose plans. Having Enes Kanter was their punishment for being able to foist Carmelo Anthony on the unsuspecting Thunder, but Joakim Noah's contract hangs around even if he doesn't really exist on the court. Tim Hardaway, Jr. is going to be a Knick for a while yet after the Knicks signed him to that offer sheet last offseason.

                The Knicks can clear a little bit of space after the season if they stretch Noah (they could stretch him now, but they shouldn't. Might as well make the dead cap hit half as much by waiting until next season) and see Kanter's deal end. Hardaway (contract expires 2020), Courtney Lee (2019) and Lance Thomas (2019) are around for two more years at least, which is unfortunate.

                Ron Baker will pick up his player option on the contract that was given to him by a New York front office in the midst of a fever dream, and Kanter can't turn his down either, but it will be mildly interesting to see if Kyle O'Quinn does the same. He'll be an unrestricted free agent after the next season if he does, so he probably will. But, already 28, he might be ready to try his luck on the open market and abandon the Knicks.

                Another reason for the Knicks to not spend any more money: Porzingis is on the last year of his deal. He'll be a Restricted Free Agent, so the Knicks will be able to match any deal, but he's going to get the maximum for a player of his age from someone even if it's not the Knicks. So they need to make sure to plan for that in budgeting meetings (do the Knicks have those?). Meanwhile, they need to see if Emmanuel Mudiay (acquired mid-season from Denver) will be worth paying or playing at any point, even as a backup to the similarly shooting challenged Frank Ntilikina.

                So, yes, without Porzingis this team is pretty unexciting beyond getting to call Ntilikina "Frankie Smokes". Maybe Fizdale can whip them into shape, and maybe they'll hit on their draft pick this year. But as for making big moves this offseason with the roster? Unless another team inexplicably calls about acquiring Joakim Noah, the Knicks should finally sit an offseason out.
