        <p>
            The 2017-2018 NBA season is over as the Cleveland Cavaliers were easily dispatched in Game 4 by the Golden State Warriors, who took the championship by sweep. From the very beginning, Cleveland didn't appear to have brought their best game. It seemed like Game 3 was their last stand. The game was close in the second quarter. For the first time in the series, though, Golden State finally did what it had done all season and used a third quarter run to put the game away, rendering the entire fourth quarter garbage time.

        <p>
            Unlike the first three games in this series, the fourth was not terribly interesting in and of itself. (Note: don't let people tell you the series was boring because of the way it ended. They are just upset because the Warriors won and they want to act like that was never in doubt. 11 of the first 12 quarters were competitive and compelling. Sweeps suck but it wasn't like this was a total waxing from start to finish and anyone who tells you it was is being disingenuous at best). The main drama came down to who would win the Finals MVP, and even though Stephen Curry put in an effort to win by scoring 37 points, he did not win. Kevin Durant, who dragged the Warriors to a win in Game 3 and then put up a quiet triple-double in Game 4, won his second straight Finals MVP.

        <p>
            With three titles in four years and the very real possibility of some more in the future, the Warriors have truly entered the conversation as one of the greatest dynastic runs of all-time. A win next year would give them three in a row to match the Lakers/Bulls, plus 4 in 5 which no one other than the Bill Russell Celtics did. They have gone 63-19 in the postseason the past four seasons, losing just one series (the 2016 Finals). They have some thinking to do about keeping the team together, if the players can handle sharing all the glory and if the ownership can handle paying all the salaries and luxury taxes. But right now they're on a run that few teams in history can rival.

            As for the Cavaliers, all eyes are on LeBron James. LeBron was harassed and harried by the Warriors after his Game 1 performance. The Warriors helped on his drives and doubled nearly every time he approached the rim when he got Curry switched on to him. LeBron passed out of these situations a lot, choosing to give a teammate an open shot over trying to score on multiple defenders. This is very LeBron of him, making the right basketball play, but some observers took this to mean he 'quit' or wasn't aggressive enough. Maybe so (the aggressive part. Not the quitting part). But for Cleveland to win, to give LeBron some breathing room, they needed to do the easy work and make wide-open shots. And far, far too often they could not. They shot over 30% from three-point range once, in Game 2 (33.3%). Kyle Korver was 1-15 for the series. J.R. Smith was 9-25. Kevin Love was 9-28. Jeff Green was 3-14. It wasn't nearly good enough, and no one other than LeBron and Rodney Hood (in Games 3 and 4) were able to create a shot on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Very little in the series gives LeBron a lot of reason to return to Cleveland. If he does, expect him to do so with a mandate to remake this team yet again. They have Kevin Love and the number 8 pick and a lot of really undesirable, anchor contracts, but they will just have to be creative. If I had to guess, I'd guess LeBron has played his last game for the Cavaliers (barring an end-of-career swan song). But LeBron will take his time, make everyone wait, and then make his decision. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So congratulations to the Warriors for their championship. It's time for the NBA offseason, and here's hoping it's crazy.
