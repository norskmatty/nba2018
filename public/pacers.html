                Everyone laughed at the Pacers when they traded Paul George to Oklahoma City for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. They didn't even get a first round pick for George to help the rebuild! No one is laughing anymore as Oladipo became a surprising star and Indiana took LeBron to more games in their series than George's Thunder took the Utah Jazz.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like those Jazz, the Pacers now have a new organizational direction that was rather unexpected. They need to build around Oladipo. Assuming Thaddeus Young signs his player option, the Pacers will only have six players they have actually committed fully to for next season, with decisions to make on their non-guaranteed players.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bojan Bogdanovic feels like a no-brainer. He had been virtually ignored in Washington the year before, but really found a place on this Pacers team. He was even able to hold his own, as much as anyone can, against LeBron in the playoffs. His shooting at the wing allows him to fit in with many different lineups.
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as Indiana might want to improve at the point guard spot, Darren Collison is still the best player they have there. Cory Joseph is a fine reserve player, but unless Indiana can clear the cap space for a better player (maybe one that is a better defender, since Oladipo can handle a lot of the duties of bringing the ball up in crunch time). Bringing back Collison also makes him a useful expiring contract if the Pacers want to improve through a trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Pacers might be ready to move on from Big Al Jefferson. He has barely played the last two seasons after being brought in for $10M a year, and was nowhere to be seen in the postseason. It's tough out there for aging bigs that can't shoot. If the Pacers want to make a move, stretching the $4M he is owed and not paying the rest can help them have the space to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lance Stephenson is somehow a fan favorite and not very expensive, but his best skill is that he gets under LeBron's skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indiana could prepare early for life without Young by signing a power forward such as Derrick Favors or Aaron Gordon, if their current teams let them get away. To address the lack of additional playmaking beyond Oladipo (and he does need some help on this team, at the very least to give him some breaks during the regular season), they could look at options like Zach LaVine or even take a flyer on Isaiah Thomas. Thomas will have trouble finding suitors after a lost season, and Indiana might be able to take a cheap chance that he can recover his explosion following the surgery he should have had last year. A reunion with Paul George, while potentially hilarious, is very unlikely.

                The RFA options like LaVine and Gordon are riskier in the sense that if their current teams match (and both the Bulls and Magic have the cap space to do so) they might miss out on the rest of free agency. They would be options only if Indiana is uninterested in any others early in free agency. If they don't sign someone, it's not the end of the world. There will still be players to be had in trades.
