            <p>
                When your best player comes out and says the team needs to change, the team might need to change. If only because he named players he thinks should leave and possibly everyone on the team hates everyone else. That does seem bad. It's tough to win in the Eastern Conference when LeBron keeps running roughshod over it, but did you know that Washington has never played a LeBron team in the John Wall/Bradley Beal era in the playoffs? They've been in the playoffs 4 of the past 5 years and in each season have lost to the team that went on to immediately lose to LeBron's team. They are always two degrees from LeBron, never more, never less.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, Wall is right when he says that Ian Mahinmi and Marcin Gortat don't quite fit in the modern NBA. Not only are the two a combined 165 years old, but neither can switch effectively or get out and chase shooting bigs to the 3-point line. And I imagine that Washington's ownership is keen to make changes as well. They already are a tax team with the 11 players under contract before filling out their roster. Who wants to pay the luxury tax for this Wizards team, which wishes they could reach the heights of teams like the 16/17 Celtics or 14/15 Hawks that beat them only to be crushed by the LeBulldozer?
            </p>
            <p>
                These potential tax issues don't even take into account that next season is Wall's last on his current deal. He'll be receiving $37.8 million in 2019-20 and getting raises up to $46.8 million by 2022-23. He also has a 15% trade kicker, in case any team actually got traction on a trade for Wall. That would make his final season cost $53.8 million when he's 31, which with John Wall's injury history would, I'm sure, be quite the deal.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's not for this offseason, but Washington is going to want to limit their salary expense from the non-Wall players in the seasons to come. To change up the roster this year, not too many other teams are likely going to be enticed by either Gortat or Mahinmi. At least Gortat's contract expires after next season, so he's the more tradeable player. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Jason Smith and Jodie Meeks are, if they exercise their player options, more easily tradeable contracts although not really useful players at this point. If they wanted to trade for a different and good player that could help them now, Kelly Oubre would be enticing, and Washington is going to be hard pressed to pay him when he needs an extension in a couple of seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Wizards can even drop one of Mahinmi/Gortat, they can give themselves short-term flexibility, but taking on additional money is going to be tough given the contracts of Wall, Beal and Otto Porter, Jr. going forward. They'll have to be judicious with the money they give out and probably have to go into playoff series relying on players like Ty Lawson last season. They do have all their first round picks going forward, so using one or two of those to bolster the roster quickly could happen. It's just hard to see a path where Washington is both good and able to consistently duck the luxury tax in the coming seasons.
