            <b>Golden State Warriors - 62 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            The Warriors had little depth and would have even less interest in caring enough about the regular season to pass 62 wins.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            The Warriors rarely brought the fastball and managed to once again not have the best record during the NBA season despite being enormous title favorites.
        </p>

            <b>Boston Celtics - 59.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Gordan Hayward would need some time to come back from the terrible injury he suffered the previous season, that the Celtics as a whole played better than they really were without Hayward/Irving, and that there would be issues sharing the ball between all the young players plus Irving and Hayward.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Hayward struggled mightily in his return to the court. Meanwhile, Jaysom Tatum developed a fetish from bad mid-range jumpers, Al Horford started looking a little older (but still crucial to the team), and the Celtics underperformed their point differential. There were also nightly quotes about everyone on the team was miserable and couldn't have a worse time if they had to spend every night getting unmedicated dental work done.

            <b>Houston Rockets - 57 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            James Harden is really good, 57 wins represented an 8 win decline from the previous year, the losses of Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute wouldn't terribly impact the regular season record. Carmelo Anthony wouldn't help but also wouldn't be enough of a negative to ruin the over.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            While James Harden had an unbelievable year, the team basically lost the over in the first two months of the year. Carmelo was indeed a disaster and while he was gone quickly, Chris Paul missed time with injury and had a rough start, and even Clint Capela missed a bunch of time and didn't look like defensive monster he was last year. Houston figured it out and turned an 11-14 start into more than 50 wins, but that start was too much to overcome.
        </p>

            <b>Toronto Raptors - 55.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Adding Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green while only subtracting DeMar DeRozan left Toronto even better than last year's 60 win team, even in spite of age-related decline from the likes of Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Kawhi Leonard skipped as many games as he could and the Toronto bench was nearly as amazing as it was last season, but Pascal Siakam made an incredible and unexpected leap into near-stardom and lifted the Raptors enough to clear the over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 3-1
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Philadelphia 76ers - 54 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            This was a tough call at the beginning of the year, but in the end the limitations of a team built offensively around Simmons and Embiid made it difficult to forsee more than 54 wins.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            An early season trade for Jimmy Butler and a trade deadline deal for Tobias Harris twice remade the team and rotation. While it improved the starting lineup, especially from an offensive standpoint, the defense is down and the depth became a negative. Butler never seemed to fit in perfectly, and Harris' offensive gifts are less useful on a team that suddenly has many mouths to feed.
        </p>

            <b>Utah Jazz - 50 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            It would be hard to improve upon last year's win total with essentially the same team, even if everyone stayed healthy. The offense would still rely too much on Donovan Mitchell as the lone player that can create his own shot, Joe Ingles is aging, and Rudy Gobert has injury worries.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Stephen Curry missed a few games, but indeed the Warriors rarely brought the fastball and managed to once again not have the best record during the NBA season.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 4-2

            <b>Milwaukee Bucks - 48.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            It was basically the same team as last year, but now with a huge upgrade in coaching in going from Jason Kidd/Joe Prunty to Mike Budenholzer. Giannis also seemed to improve every single season and still had room to grow. The roster was talented and deep.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Milwaukee destroyed this total as Giannis made a strong case for MVP despite another amazing season from Harden and the team went from one of the worst defenses in the league to the best after adding Brooks Lopez and the aforementioned coaching change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 5-2
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Oklahoma City Thunder - 48.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Even with Paul George back, it felt a stretch to expect this many wins from a team that had an offense that was essentially two players (George and Westbrook), Andre Roberson's status was unknown, and Dennis Schroder seemed better as a backup point guard but still a negative overall.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            The Thunder were on pace to hit this, thanks in part to a Paul George stealth MVP run, until George hurt his shoulder at the end of February. The team plummeted without him and didn't come out of the tailspin even after he returned. The defense suffered without Roberson, who never made an appearance, the offense struggled to be league average, and all the triple-doubles couldn't hide the fact that Russell Westbrook had his worst season in years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 6-2
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Indiana Pacers - 47.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            A quietly good team would win at least as many games as last year after adding Tyreke Evans in the offseason to help their biggest weakness, which had been the lack of an offensive weapon in the minutes (or games) that Victor Oladipo missed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Oladipo was lost mid-way through the season to a gruesome knee injury and missed more than half the season, and Tyreke Evans was largely ineffective. In spite of this, the Pacers rode a defense buoyed by the huge step forward taken by Myles Turner and scrapped out just enough offense to win just enough games to hit this over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 7-2
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Denver Nuggets - 47.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            The team was young and on the rise, with Nikola Jokic in particular ready to blossom into a true star. They would also have Paul Millsap back (he missed more than half of the previous season) and they were a much better team when he played.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Despite slowing down toward the end of the season and various injuries/underperformance from Jamal Murray, Gary Harris and Will Barton, the Nuggets blew past this total. Jokic was indeed great, making a play for All-NBA, and the injuries to the star guards was mitigated somewhat by the competent play of Monte Morris and Malik Beasley.
        </p>

            <b>Los Angeles Lakers - 47.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            It was a bit of a risk to suggest that a LeBron team would win less than 48 games. But his teammates were a combination of as yet unproven youngsters and proven (to not be very good) veterans. He himself seemed to be in Los Angeles for more than basketball reasons. The Western Conference is, top-to-bottom, more difficult to coast through.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            LeBron got hurt on Christmas Day and the Lakers died. Injuries to Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram (who had looked as good as he ever has for about a month before he suffered a blood clot) did not help matters. Even when he returned, LeBron was not 100% healthy, and soon the handwringing about the upcoming offseason was the Lakers' only focus.

            <b>Washington Wizards - 45.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            I have never really bought into the Wizards, and the idea of adding Dwight Howard to a locker room that swirled with rumors of discontent didn't seem promising. John Wall needed to come back from injury, and the depth beyond Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter was suspect. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            John Wall tore his achilles, but the team was already floundering at that point. Beal actually had a great individual season, and Thomas Bryant showed some offensive talent. But Howard didn't play, Bryant was a sieve on defense, and by the trade deadline Porter was gone and replaced by Jabari Parker. Unsurprisingly, the Wizards did not even sniff this win total.
        </p>

            <b>New Orleans Pelicans - 45.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Anthony Davis was reaching the peak of his powers, and Jrue Holiday is an excellent second best player to have around. A full season of Nikola Mirotic would help the Pelicans at the very least maintain the momentum from the previous season, as the Pelicans attempted to do just enough to convince Davis to remain past the 2019/20 season.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            The Pelicans had nothing at the point guard position following an injury to Elfrid Payton and stumbled out of the gate. Toward the trade deadline, you may have heard that Davis' agent proclaimed that he would not be staying and was asking for a trade to the Lakers. The Pelicans, possibly motivated at least a little by spite, did not acquiesce, and in the midst of this mess did not ever approach even a .500 record.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 10-3

            <b>Miami Heat - 43.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            A good coach and a team with little star talent but decent depth would once again figure out how to squeeze enough wins in what would turn out to be Dwayne Wade's retirement tour.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            A bad, injury-marred season from Goran Dragic didn't help, but this team played less than the sum of its parts and struggled to reach .500, falling just short of this total.

            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Popovich magic, basically. This is a franchise that has essentially never won fewer than 44 games in any season during Pop's long tenure. DeMar DeRozan would be better than the nothing the Spurs got from Kawhi Leonard the previous year, and they'd figure out how to make their limited roster a playoff team in the West yet again, somehow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            A bad beat, really, if you took the under. The team was poor on defense and it's approach to offense could charitably be termed "throwback" (although "inefficient shot selection" is more apt). In spite of this, they showed incredible and perhaps flukey shot making ability, vaulting their offense above expectation based on shot selection, and once again got useful contributions from in-house young players (Davis Bertans and Derrick White in particular). Popovich magic.

            <b>Portland Blazers - 42 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            This was a ridiculously low total that seemed to indicate everyone's only interaction with the Blazers was that playoff series where they were destroyed by the Pelicans. In the regular season, when teams aren't trapping Damian Lillard and forcing his bad teammates to make plays, this well-coached, deep team with a star in Lillard should always be above .500.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Duh. The Blazers won 50 games, thanks in part to Jusif Nurkic taking a step forward on both offense and defense and Lillard continuing to be one of the best players in the league. Even a down season from C.J. McCollum and a disappointing campaign from Zach Collins wasn't enough to prevent Portland from obliterating this insulting total.

            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            A bad defensive team outplayed their fundmamentals the previous year. Oh, and the star player (Jimmy Butler) wanted to be traded so bad he was willing to torpedo the season.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            The Timberwolves at first refused to trade Butler, and the team struggled out of the gate. While the trade of Butler seemed to help Karl-Anthony Towns blossom into an offensive beast, the defense was still bad (especially with Robert Covington missing extended time) and Andrew Wiggins was shockingly atrocious.

            <b>Detroit Pistons - 38.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            This is a team that had exactly one good offensive player (Blake Griffin), zero wing depth (hardly any wing players at all), an overpaid center whose individual rebounding numbers belie the fact that his teams always rebound worse as a whole, and a point guard that had never been the same since a knee injury a couple years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            All of that was basically true, but the Pistons won anyway. Why? Andre Drummond was legitimately better in the second half of the year, but Blake Griffin's year-long excellence and some hot shooting during a big post-All Star run gave the Pistons just enough juice to make it over this number. Give Dwayne Casey a little credit, too, he did pretty well considering the sad state of affairs on this roster.

            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            It seemed that the oddsmakers were rather underrating the potential of a team with a great deal of depth, even if there were no standout superstars. This team was loaded with viable NBA players, and the only risk was that they would trade enough of them away in order to tank later in the season.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            The Clippers, ah, did not have the opportunity to tank. For one brief moment, they were the 2-seed in the West. Although they dropped from those lofty heights, they still were so far above this win total pace that they cleared it by February. A breakout season for Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams made their bench units unstoppable and helped overcome the weakness of their starting group early in the season.

            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Belief that a team that added Luka Doncic and vastly underperformed their point differential last season (due in large part to aggressive tanking) would be enough to hit this modest total.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Luka Doncic was great early in the season. The Mavericks weren't particularly good, but threatened this total until the trade deadline, when they traded Harrison Barnes and DeAndre Jordan away and gained in return Tim Hardaway (promptly injured) and Kristaps Porzingis (already injured). They strapped on the tank treads at that point and fell short of the total.

            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            While the non-Kemba Walker pieces on this team are not great, I believed that Kemba alone would be enough to get this team to at least challenge for a playoff spot in the post-LeBron east, which would mean getting at least to this total.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            They barely made it. Kemba had a fantastic year (in what might end up being his Charlotte swan song) and the remaining Hornets were indeed mostly anchors on his feet. They didn't make the playoffs but were always just close enough that tanking wasn't an option.

            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            I always pause before choosing a team with a player as good as Mike Conley to win this few games. They didn't have him for almost all of last year and were predictably terrible. Part of the thought here was that they would finally trade he and Marc Gasol and commit to a rebuild.

            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Marc Gasol was traded, but Mike Conley was not. Jaren Jackson had an encouraging rookie season stopped short by injury. Even with Conley's typical good season, the remaining Grizzlies were a mish-mash of veterans playing out the string after being traded there from good teams and they made sure to have a late-season swoon in part to help try to keep their top-8 protected draft pick this season.

            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            This was another team that massively underperformed their point differential last season. Even though they finally had their own draft pick to tank for after years and years of handing them to Boston, they were always a team that tried hard and had players like Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie that were just a little better than their league-wide reputations suggested.

        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            A lot of players took steps forward that were largely unexpected. Dinwiddie and Harris were better and they saw Jarrett Allen turn into a block meme machine. The biggest difference, however, was DeAngelo Russell taking on a huge usage and, while not exactly being the most efficient player, doing enough to cause everyone to say the Lakers were stupid to trade him (not a take I agree with). Anyway, this team of scraps and players hardly anyone wanted outperformed teams that had LeBron James and Anthony Davis and soared past their total.

            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            The loss of LeBron was baked into the projection of 22 fewer wins than the previous year. But they still had capable players like Kevin Love, J.R. Smith, Tristan Thompson and George Hill and they were making noises about going for the playoffs instead of selling off and rebuilding. I (foolishly) bought in.

        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Easily my worst choice and the one I feel the dumbest about. J.R. Smith was quickly booted from the team, essentially, after showing much disinterest in the proceedings. Love and Thompson were hurt early and by the time they returned the season was absolutely lost. They struggled to win 20 games and had one of the worst defenses in the history of the league. The bright spot? Collin Sexton stopped looking like the absolute worst player in the league and settled toward solidly below-average?

            <b>Prediction: Under </b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            I had no faith in this team that didn't have much depth or really much at all beyond Nic Vucevic and the potential of Aaron Gordon. I was also pricing in the potential that Fournier, Gordon and/or Vucevic would be moved in a move to tank as much as possible.

        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            I was pretty wrong on this one. Both Vucevic and D.J. Augustin had great years and combined with Fournier and Gordon gave the Magic something approaching a legitimately decent starting lineup. An end of season playoff push (the Magic won 10 of their final 12) turned this into a laughably wrong guess from simply a wrong one, to add insult to injury.

            <b>Chicago Bulls - 30 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under </b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            This was, along with Portland, the one I felt the best about. The Bulls were full of terrible players that couldn't play defense and Lauri Markannen was destined to miss at least the first few months of the season. While some thought the Bulls would make a playoff run, I felt the total was at least 6 wins too high for this group.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Interestingly, the Bulls actually put together a decent defense early in the season but more than made up for it by being dead last in offense, which was the exact opposite of my thoughts. Eventually, they cratered on defense and never improved the offense much, and so were indeed not close to the 30 win mark. Wendell Carter was a bright spot, at least, putting together a promising rookie season.

            <b>Prediction: Under </b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            It's always interesting when you see a team projected to win just 29 games and your first reaction is to think, "Wow, that high?". There seemed to be some thoughts in the dark corners of the discourse that Phoenix was making a playoff push after drafting DeAndre Ayton and signing Trevor Ariza. But, come on. There was still no point guard (for the second season in a row) and Devin Booker has yet to prove he's more than a very good scorer on a terrible team.

        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Devin Booker was a very good scorer on a terrible team. Ayton had a rough rookie season and anchored one of the league's worst defenses while Booker got very little help on the offensive end. At no point did they get even the smallest whiff of either making the playoffs or surpassing this win total. Trevor Ariza barely lasted two months in this morass before being shipped off to Washington's morass.

            <b>Prediction: Under </b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            This was a team that had precisely zero above-average players except for Kristaps Porzingis, who was set to miss a good portion of the season after suffering an ACL tear last year. Barring some unexpected great things from players like Kevin Knox and Frank Ntilikina,

            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Rookie Mitchell Robinson showed some encouraging shot-blocking abilities, but other than that this was not only the worst team in the league, but one of the least interesting to watch. Kevin Knox had perhaps the worst season of any player in the past five years, Ntilikina is starting to make everyone concerned his offense is so bad it will more than offset his defensive abilities, and nothing else of note happened here.

            Yet another bad team that added my least favorite top 5 draft pick (Marvin Bagley), made it seem like they were going to start him as the small forward despite his utterly lacking that skillset, and whose best player (De'Aaron Fox) was a second-year point guard coming off a promising but miserable season.

        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Yeah, wow. This team stuck it to everyone, including myself, that didn't expect anything out of them. Fox was one of the most improved players from last year to this year. Bagley did not actually play small forward, and had a nice season overall. Buddy Hield finally looked like the sharpshooter he was supposed to be coming out of college (even if his game lacks much else). They put together a playoff push that was still impressive even as they petered out toward the end of the year. The Kings beat this win total in early January, easily the first team to do so.

            Despite thinking that Trae Young would struggle in his first season, I still went over because I kind of liked this collection of talent with John Collins, Taurean Prince, Dwayne Dedmon and the ageless Vince Carter. Also, 23 wins is not really that many wins!

            Young indeed sucked in the beginning of the year, but in the second half of the year was so good he made a late push for Rookie of the Year consideration. His shooting came around, his passing is a huge plus, and even though his defense is lurking around the level of 'Isaiah Thomas' he's overall a positive player. The Hawks were in the bottom third of the league in both offense and defense, and were pretty bad (albeit one of the most fun League Pass teams, especially later in the year), but caught a few breaks in close games and you know what? 23 wins isn't all that many wins.

            I will absolutely take an overall record of 21-9 considering some horrid choices such as the Cleveland over and the Sacramento under. A little bit of luck was on my side, but for the most part I felt good about the thought process behind each pick.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next year, I'm sure I'll regress and get, like, 14 right, but for now I'll bask in my prognostication glory.
