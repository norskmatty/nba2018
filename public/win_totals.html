        2018/19 Win Totals: A Review

            <b>Golden State - 62 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            The Warriors had little depth and would have even less interest in caring enough about the regular season to pass 62 wins.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Stephen Curry missed a few games, but indeed the Warriors rarely brought the fastball and managed to once again not have the best record during the NBA season.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 1-0
        </p>

            <b>Boston - 59.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Gordan Hayward would need some time to come back from the terrible injury he suffered the previous season, that the Celtics as a whole played better than they really were without Hayward/Irving, and that there would be issues sharing the ball between all the young players plus Irving and Hayward.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Hayward struggled mightily in his return to the court. Meanwhile, Jaysom Tatum developed a fetish from bad mid-range jumpers, Al Horford started looking a little older (but still crucial to the team), and the Celtics underperformed their point differential. There were also nightly quotes about everyone on the team was miserable and couldn't have a worse time if they had to spend every night getting unmedicated dental work done.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 2-0
        </p>

            <b>Houston - 57 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            James Harden is really good, 57 wins represented an 8 win decline from the previous year, the losses of Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute wouldn't terribly impact the regular season record. Carmelo Anthony wouldn't help but also wouldn't be enough of a negative to ruin the over.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            While James Harden had an unbelievable year, the team basically lost the over in the first two months of the year. Carmelo was indeed a disaster and while he was gone quickly, Chris Paul missed time with injury and had a rough start, and even Clint Capela missed a bunch of time. Houston figured it out and turned an 11-14 start into more than 50 wins, but that start was too much to overcome.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 2-1
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Toronto - 55.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Adding Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green while only subtracting DeMar DeRozan left Toronto even better than last year's 60 win team, even in spite of age-related decline from the likes of Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Kawhi Leonard skipped as many games as he could and the Toronto bench was nearly as amazing as it was last season, but Pascal Siakam made an incredible and unexpected leap into near-stardom and lifted the Raptors enough to clear the over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 3-1
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Philadelphia - 54 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            This was a tough call at the beginning of the year, but in the end the limitations of a team built offensively around Simmons and Embiid made it difficult to forsee more than 54 wins.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            An early season trade for Jimmy Butler and a trade deadline deal for Tobias Harris twice remade the team and rotation. While it improved the starting lineup, especially from an offensive standpoint, the defense is down and the depth became a negative. Butler never seemed to fit in perfectly, and Harris' offensive gifts are less useful on a team that suddenly has many mouths to feed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 4-1
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Utah - 50 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            It would be hard to improve upon last year's win total with essentially the same team, even if everyone stayed healthy. The offense would still rely too much on Donovan Mitchell as the lone player that can create his own shot, Joe Ingles is aging, and Rudy Gobert has injury worries.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Stephen Curry missed a few games, but indeed the Warriors rarely brought the fastball and managed to once again not have the best record during the NBA season.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 4-2
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Milwaukee - 48.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Over</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            It was basically the same team as last year, but now with a huge upgrade in coaching in going from Jason Kidd/Joe Prunty to Mike Budenholzer. Giannis also seemed to improve every single season and still had room to grow. The roster was talented and deep.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Over</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            Milwaukee destroyed this total as Giannis made a strong case for MVP despite another amazing season from Harden and the team went from one of the worst defenses in the league to the best after adding Brooks Lopez and the aforementioned coaching change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 5-2
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Oklahoma City - 48.5 wins</b> <br>
            <b>Prediction: Under</b><br>
            <b>What was the thought process?</b><br>
            Even with Paul George back, it felt a stretch to expect this many wins from a team that had an offense that was essentially two players (George and Westbrook), Andre Robison's status was unknown, and Dennis Schroder seemed better as a backup point guard but still a negative overall.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: Under</b><br>
            <b>What happened?</b><br>
            The Thunder managed to actually be on pace to hit this, thanks in part to a Paul George stealth MVP run, until George hurt his shoulder. The team plummeted without him and didn't come out of the tailspin even after he returned. The defense suffered, the offense struggled to be league average, and all the triple-doubles couldn't hide the fact that Westbrook had his worst season in years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Record: 6-2
