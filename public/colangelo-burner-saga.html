            The Bryan Colangelo burner saga ended with an anti-climax: his wife did it. In a statement released by Colangelo, his wife was 100% responsible, he knew nothing about it, the information was inaccurate, and he's resigning anyway because he really doesn't have any other choice. It is his one hope of a future in the NBA, although at this point his name is so toxic that even his dad, Jerry Colangelo, probably couldn't get him a job hocking peanuts in the stands of an NBA arena next season.

            What does this mean for the participants in the saga, willing or unwilling? Nobody wins here, but who lost more and how do they proceed?
        </p>
        <p><b>Adam Silver</b></p>
        <p>
            Commissioner Silver, at the very least, set the Philadelphia 76ers' ownership up with the Colangelos. Jerry was hired to be a consultant for the team while Sam Hinkie was still in charge. Soon, Hinkie was gone (he resigned, in one of those I'll-resign-so-you-can't-fire-me deals) and Colangelo the Elder recommended, and got, Colangelo the Younger installed. It's unknown how much pressure Silver and NBA executives put on the Sixers to ditch the Hinkie Process (which they made no secret about hating) and bring in some NBA old guard to run the franchise like a good, honest, kind of dumb franchise. Silver set this whole thing in motion because he probably wanted Hinkie gone, and maybe he regrets even that now.
        </p>
        <p> <b>Jerry Colangelo </b> </p>
        <p>
            The elder Colangelo, as special advisor, helped Josh Harris and the Sixers' ownership figure out who to hire to replace Sam Hinkie. Because this is the Age of Nepotism, he came up with a short list of candidates but with Bryan Colangelo, his son, the lead choice. Bryan had not been doing anything since being fired/resigning (again, they're kind of the same) from the general manager position in Toronto. Bryan, by the way, went on Toronto radio after Chris Bosh left for the Miami Heat in 2010 to talk about Bosh, where he insinuated that Bosh could have played at the end of the season, but sat out injured instead. That sort of injury talk reminds of some of the comments from the burner accounts referenced in the original story from The Ringer. So, Jerry's son is already known for being kind of a dick and hadn't had a job for three years, but the Sixers hire him anyway to appease the NBA and his papa.

        <p><b>Barbara Bottini</b></p>
        <p>
            Bryan Colangelo's wife, she was apparently outed as the owner of the burner accounts that tweeted all the confidential information and inflammatory rhetoric that got Bryan into trouble. As Bryan's statement tried to make clear, he had no knowledge of the accounts nor does he believe that he was her source for any of her statements, many of which expose previously unknown information about current and former players like Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Joel Embiid and Markelle Fultz. Bryan also said she got much of her statements wrong. However, a lot of what the accounts tweeted out have been confirmed by reporters who said they knew about the information but hadn't divulged it because it was not on the record and, in the case of the injury news, not fit for public distribution. It certainly is possible that Barbara was a good sleuth, rooted out all this information about players either she or Bryan did not personally like, and then attempted to defend the honor of her husband by tweeting it to various fansites and reporters. It seems more likely that Bryan brought his work home with him, shared the various things that were going on that was frustrating him, and she took this info and ran with it, expecting it to be okay because of her anonymity. And if she had kept it to just talking about collars and saying Colangelo was doing a good job and Hinkie wasn't the genius everyone keeps saying he is, this might not have been a problem. But because she talked about players, and shared things about them that were never meant to be shared, there was simply no way that Bryan could remain in the Sixers organization. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Bryan Colangelo</b></p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, Bryan Colangelo was the man in charge, the man who apparently shared the same opinions as the burner accounts even if he did not personally run them. He seems like, and let's be honest here, a bit of a prick. He has the job through the privilege of having a well-connected and powerful father, and maybe he realizes that deep down, he needs validation that even though he got the job through family connections he is still doing it well and was deserving. That sort of insecurity is very human, and if he took notice of the (very vocal) contingent on of Process Truthers on Twitter that hated him and kept giving credit to Hinkie it wouldn't be very surprising. If he took that home with him, confided his issues and complaints with his wife, that wouldn't be very surprising, either. It seems he has a pretty dim view of injured players, of course, and he still seems the most likely source for his wife to get that information to tweet to blogs and reporters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Does Bryan Colangelo 'deserve' to be fired if he truly did not know about the burner accounts? Maybe not, but so much of being a leader in the NBA or anything is trust. And there will always be questions about how much he knew, how much he was sharing, and how that information made it's way onto the toxic slime of social media. He may never have that trust with agents and players again, even if owners and other executives might quietly understand. This is a big offseason for Philadelphia, with a 51-win team, two obvious stars in Embiid and Ben Simmons, and the potential to have enough cap space to bring in a third. They can't risk losing out on a player because that player feels insecure about sensitive information that might be leaked out by Colangelo or a family member. We will see if Bryan ever gets another job in the NBA again. He might get a special advisor role at some point, like his father (and maybe again because of his father). But another GM role seems really unlikely. His next order of business is probably going to be divorce proceedings, or really awkward dinnertime conversations with the family.
        </p>
        <p><b>The Philadelphia 76ers and owner Josh Harris</b></p>
        <p>
            Harris let himself get talked into hiring Colangelo and letting Hinkie go because he was concerned that other teams' (and their owners) thought he was doing it wrong by tanking so hard and aggressively. The league convinced him that he was being embarrassed and Hinkie was an embarrassment for the league. Well! Hinkie wasn't 20% the embarrassment that Colangelo turned out to be. Good work, all.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Hinkie and Colangelo, the Sixers have seen two straight general managers leave under negative circumstances, and both ultimately were encouraged to resign. While this might make the organization look like they are poorly run, candidates for the now open job are probably not going to care much. The Sixers' job is still a good one right now, because of the talent on the roster and that there is room to continue to grow it into a potential championship-caliber roster. Plus, general manager candidates are going to understand why Colangelo was forced to resign. They know that as long as they don't (or have their family members) tweet out injury information or try to lose 70 games a year, they won't have to resign in embarrassment. So, although you could argue that the Sixers firing Hinkie and hiring Colangelo was, in retrospect, a bad move, it's one that's unlikely to harm them in the long run.

            There's one thing left to say, when it comes to social media. Never tweet, and make sure your spouse also knows to never tweet anything you say. It's the only way to be safe.
