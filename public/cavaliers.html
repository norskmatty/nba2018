                Another year, another Finals appearance. That's become rote for LeBron, and by extension the Cavaliers. But if LeBron leaves, and he very well could abandon this ship, the Cavaliers are instantly playoff fodder, if not a lottery team outright.
            </p>
            <p>
                LeBron has a player option that keeps him around for $35.6M if he exercises it. Doing this immediately keeps the Cavaliers in the luxury tax, where they have lived for a few years now. The Cavaliers could also grant LeBron an extension, but so far he has been unwilling to sign anything that removes his ability to leave at the end of each season. In fact, him staying most likely plays out with him declining the option and then signing another one year contract with a second year player option. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If LeBron opts in, it's perhaps only to help facilitate a trade to a cap-starved team that he wants to go to. That way, whatever team he chooses can trade Cleveland assets for LeBron, like draft picks (worthless to LeBron), young players (same) and whatever salary is necessary to make the trade work while that team doesn't have to worry about the cap calisthenics required to sign LeBron as a free agent. Cleveland isn't going to be wild about doing this, but if LeBron wants to leave they'll pretty much have to do it anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the occasion that LeBron stays, it would have to be with the understanding that they would once again try to undo the screw-ups that have led them into the current roster construction. You might correctly wonder what Cleveland could possibly do to untangle the disaster of a cap sheet that they have put together, where there's a legitimate argument to be made that the third best player is either 37-year-old Kyle Korver or Jeff Green on a team paying a hefty luxury tax. A Jeff Green that was properly paid at the minimum last season but is technically a free agent and who would have ever thought that would be a problem for a team? A better question might be who wants any of their players after watching them wilt in the playoff spotlight while LeBron carried them to the Finals?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, one, NBA teams can be talked into a lot of things. Two, the team was basically thrown together in the last minute at the trade deadline after the previous Cavaliers roster proved to be similarly bad following the Kyrie Irving trade. None of these players added at the deadline (Rodney Hood, Larry Nance, Jr., Jordan Clarkson) were probably prepared to deal with the sudden swing from playing on bad teams to playing on the expected Eastern Conference champion with LeBron demanding pure excellence. George Hill, at least, proved somewhat valuable. Am I saying that the non-LeBron Cavaliers are secretly good? Goodness, no. Just that you could make cases for some of their younger players having value in other situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                They could still use the Nets pick gained in the Kyrie trade. Also, they could finally swing one of those Kevin Love trades they always feel ready to make.
            </p>
            <p>
                If LeBron leaves, well, then the rebuild is on. They aren't many decisions to make other than Rodney Hood, who became utterly useless in the playoffs and is a restricted free agent. Hill, Clarkson, Korver, J.R. Smith, Love and Tristan Thompson all have contracts that expire after two more seasons, in the 2020 offseason. While they could very well trade some of those players, if they don't add significant long-term money they would be looking at a painful two seasons followed by a practically pristine cap sheet starting in that 2020 offseason. Nance, Jr. will be a restricted free agent in the 2019 offseason, so he could be the only player with any sort of significant deal going into 2020.

                Seeing what could be gotten for Love at this point would be paramount for Cleveland. In fact, if LeBron leaves, all their players should be available, if anyone is interested, with Cleveland even being willing to take bad salary in return in order to get an asset if possible (of course, a lot of Cleveland's salary is bad but could be useful players on a contender if not all on the same one). It could be tough to get a taker on Thompson or Smith, and Korver isn't going to exactly fetch a lot in return, but anything you can get for them at that point would be worth taking. The Cavaliers will want to be bad, really bad, in order to keep their first round picks the next two years (both only protected for the top ten) before that pick owed to Atlanta turns into two seconds if they hold onto it through 2020.

                As has been the case for most of the last 15 years, the Cavaliers' decisions and success will ultimately come down to whatever LeBron James wants to do. He won a championship in Cleveland, he's done what he wanted to do. If he decides to leave a second time for greener pastures or the Lakers, the Cavs will just have to look back fondly on what he's done for them and accept it. If he decides to stay, they have to pay a huge luxury tax but remain relevant. They don't get any agency for themselves until he leaves, but that's fine. That's the price you willingly pay to have LeBron.
