                The Bulls were season-long tankers, going into the season with no real reason to do anything but once they traded Jimmy Butler for Kris Dunn and Zach LaVine. They were rather successful at it, too, except for a brief moment when Nikola Mirotic returned from being punched by teammate Bobby Portis. This forced the Bulls to ship Mirotic off to New Orleans for a late first round pick and Omer Asik (playing Asik is, at this point, one of the best tanking moves a team can make, although the Bulls didn't actually do this).
            </p>
            <p>
                There were some promising signs. Kris Dunn improved his shooting numbers (which were ghastly the previous season in Minnesota) to something approaching acceptable and Lauri Markkanen looked every bit the shooting big he was drafted to be. 
            </p>
            <p>
                LaVine only played in 27 games, coming back from a torn ACL. His numbers were down from the previous season, but he still has elite scoring potential if he can stay healthy. The question for the Bulls is how much they want to pay him for that potential. LaVine has been open about wanting to get paid as an elite player, but as a Restricted Free Agent with an injury history, the Bulls have little motivation to offer him close to the max. If some other team does, the Bulls can match. If not, they can get him on a better deal. The Bulls currently have a very healthy cap sheet, but overextending on a player like LaVine can turn that situation back around, especially if he doesn't develop past his current level of inefficient scoring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another player the Bulls need to make a decision on is Noah Vonleh. Acquired from the Blazers, who dumped him simply to avoid the luxury tax, the former lottery pick never showed much beyond rotation-level energy power forward, and by the end of the season he wasn't even rotation-level for Portland. Chicago had him spend his 21 games trying to show he could stretch the floor, but his 30% shooting on 2.9 3's a game wasn't pretty. He is also an RFA and shouldn't break the bank if the Bulls decide they want to see more than just those 21 games.
            </p>
            <p>
                David Nwaba plays a little like Ben Simmons if Simmons was six inches shorter. He doesn't shoot 3's. He doesn't shoot mid-range jump shots. He either gets into the paint with his bulky physicality or he helps create shots for those who can shoot. He fits on a team with other shooters around him, and was a nice surprise for the Bulls. They can bring him back on a very reasonable deal and have little reason not to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than that, Chicago can either ruin some other team's day by offering big money to a restricted free agent on a cap-strapped team (the Nets have been masters of this in previous offseasons) or just sit and wait until 2019, when Robin Lopez and Aisk disappear from the books (Asik has $3M guaranteed of his $11.9M total for next year, stretching that or simply paying it all next year would be easy enough). Depending on what they end up giving LaVine, the Bulls could have a similarly robust amount of cap space and even the free agents available to spend it on next year. They could use a center if they aren't going to bring back Lopez, but they may find one in the draft or wait until next year. It's a center, there's no hurry.
