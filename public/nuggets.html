            <p>
                For the second straight season, the Denver Nuggets missed the postseason by one game, this time by losing what was effectively a play-in game to the Timberwolves on the final day of the season. It was a disappointment for a team hoping that internal improvement in their young players (Gary Harris, Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray) plus the addition of veteran Paul Millsap would put them over the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                It did, in a way. Denver won six more games than the previous season, even though Millsap missed 45 games to injury (Harris also missed 15). They only won three fewer games than Portland, who finished as the 3-seed. It was that kind of year in the Western Conference. Led by their talented offensive players, Denver posted the sixth best Offensive Net Rating but ended up missing the playoffs in large part because they finished 26th in Defensive Net Rating. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It might be difficult to ever have a truly elite defense while Jokic, one of the slowest players in the league while offering little rim protection, mans the paint. But improvement there has to be made. The idea with Millsap was that he would help shore up the defense with his physical presence near the rim, and the team defended at roughly a league average level with him on the floor (107.0 Defensive Net Rating, which would have been 16th). But Millsap missed a lot of time and the defense was non-existent without him (109.0 Defensive Net Rating, which would have been 28th).
            </p>
            <p>
                But Jokic is part of the young core and is also due a massive extension, one that could put the Nuggets easily into the tax if Wilson Chandler and Darrell Arthur pick up their player options. Denver could delay the extension one season to start next year by having Jokic play on his small club option (and increase their flexibility next offseason when Chandler, Arthur and the buried Kenneth Faried all see their contracts expire), but that risks Jokic moving on as an unrestricted free agent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along with paying Jokic, Denver also needs to decide if they want to go even deeper into commitment to this particular team and re-sign Will Barton. Barton was instrumental in keeping Denver alive while Harris missed time, and is still young enough to contribute as the young Denver core matures. He is, however, a reserve player on this team and if they can't or don't want to use an asset to drop some contracts, the team will be very expensive with he and Jokic both back on new deals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving Faried is a possibility now that he has an expiring contract, even though he now barely plays for Denver. Both sides would probably be happy to end the relationship at this point. The Mason Plumlee deal, which was obviously bad the moment it was signed, is very much not tradeable. If Chandler and/or Arthur opt-in, they could also be on the move, although Denver doesn't have another wing that could adequately fill Chandler's role on the roster unless Juan Hernangomez can make strides both offensively and defensively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Barring getting to add a Kawhi Leonard-type player, it might be best for Denver to simply bring this team back for another year, see how their young stars (and role players like Trey Lyles, Hernangomez, Malik Beasley) continue to grow, and go into the next season with a little more flexibility, a better idea of their needs going forward, and perhaps a more robust free agent market to dive into.
