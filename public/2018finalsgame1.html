        <label class="caption right">LeBron expresses the phrase, "Why did you do that?" better than anyone in history. </label>
        <p>
            Most observers spent the days between Golden State beating Houston in Game 7 and Game 1 of the NBA Finals (Warriors-Cavs IV) grousing about the sameness of the matchup and how the outcome of Warriors win was fait accompli. While the sentiment is easy to understand, after watching Game 1 I think we can say that this series could be much more interesting than we thought. And we might also say that there's no way that Houston or Boston would have been as or more compelling than LeBron, the ronin warrior of the NBA, facing off against the multi-headed hydra of the Warriors and nearly coming away with a victory.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't something that could be said often this year of the Cavaliers, but they played well. It's common for Warriors losses or close games to end with the belief that the Warriors must have played bad. And, certainly, there were things the Warriors could or should have done to be better. But that takes too much away from their opponents in this case. LeBron's 51 was necessary to keep the offense afloat (49 of these came in regulation, driving them to the tie). The Cavaliers did miss their open shots. But they also played their best game of the playoffs, maybe the season, with their effort on defense and their movement on offense.
        </p>
        <p>
            And they still lost. Let's dig into what made that so demoralizing, and why if they can keep their heads up they can still stay in this series.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only could they have won this game, you can easily make the argument that they should have won it, and might have done so without breaking a sweat at the end if they could make an open three-pointer. LeBron was 3-7, the rest of the team was 7-30 (23.3%). Kevin Love, back after missing most of the last two games of the conference finals with concussion symptoms, went 1-8. Jeff Green was 1-6. Jordan Clarkson was 0-3 (and 2-9 overall). I lost count of the number of open corner looks that LeBron generated and watched his teammates miss. The Cavs were 6-20 on wide-open threes, as the entire team turned collectively into a bunch of Marcus Smarts.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may have heard about refereeing controversies after the game. LeBron and the Cavs felt they were on the wrong end of more calls than the right end, but were most aggrieved by the play you've probably seen already, the charging call that was changed to a blocking call after review with 36.4 seconds left and the Cavaliers up by two. The reason the refs could make that change is because the NBA rulebook allows the referees to call for review if they want confirmation that the player taking the charge is outside the restricted area. Note that they aren't allowed to call for a review if they aren't sure about the charge/block but are sure the player was not in the restricted area. Once in that review, they can then review the entire play and change the charge to a block. Wording the rule like this also means they cannot review any blocking call, since where the player is in the restricted area is irrelevant.

        <label class="caption left"> The referees would like you to believe that they were not sure if LeBron was out of the restricted area. </label>
        <p>
            On the <a href="http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play/_/id/12933623?id=23669539&s=espn">Lowe Post podcast</a>, Brian Windhorst said that the Cavaliers likened the situation to the police performing an illegal search and finding evidence of a crime: the process stinks. I like this analogy. I understand that it's nice to get the call right. But it's also bizarre that in this particular situation, the refs can change a subjective judgment call (and no matter how obvious you believe the call was to make, it's still a judgment), which they cannot do in any other situation. For example, if the referees review an out of bounds call, they cannot see a foul on review and assess it. In this case, it was easy for the Cavaliers to believe that the referees used the excuse of needing to confirm that LeBron wasn't in the restricted area to review the call itself. LeBron was very clearly not in the restricted area.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, the call was what it was, and Durant was able to tie the game with free throws. LeBron and Stephen Curry traded layups, with Curry getting an additional free throw due to a late and wild contest from Love that resulted in Love slapping Curry without really affecting the shot. The Cavaliers had the call with 23.5 seconds left. After LeBron let the clock run down, George Hill suddenly makes an alert cut to the basket that catches Klay Thompson by surprise. Trying to stop what was suddenly looking like an easy layup, Thompson hooked Hill by the arm and took the foul, sending Hill to the line. Hill made the first free throw to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left, setting up a moment that every Cavaliers fan will always remember, probably when they least want to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hill borked the second free throw. J.R. Smith was, for some reason, the rebounder on the side of the court alongside Kevin Durant. Not to disparage Durant here, but he shows less interest in boxing out for this rebound than an infant does in particle physics. Smith gets the rebound, giving the Cavaliers a chance to get another shot and steal Game 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smith has three options. The first is taking a shot himself. There isn't much time left, but he could go up with the ball with a floater. Perhaps he doesn't trust his floater game (he has taken very few shots that weren't either threes or long twos these entire playoffs), so he take option two, which is pass to a shooter. Since LeBron was hanging back, presumably to play defense if Golden State got the board and pushed for a shot of their own, he was standing at the top of the three-point arc with no Warriors anywhere near him. Smith could have easily hit LeBron with a pass, and LeBron would have had enough time to take the shot to potentially win the game with a buzzer beater. If Smith is so surprised he has the rebound and doesn't think to do either, he could call a timeout and give Tyronn Lue to draw up a play to get LeBron a shot to win it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smith chooses option four, unfortunately. Evidently believing that the Cavaliers were ahead, not tied, Smith dribbles aimlessly away from the basket and does nothing while LeBron loses his mind. By the time Smith can be convinced to give up the ball, he fires it to a covered George Hill, who misses the shot. LeBron is so upset with Smith that he makes an expression that quickly becomes the meme of the week. The game is still tied, and Cleveland goes on to roll over and die in overtime. After the game, Smith said that he knew the game was tied but decided to do what he did anyway. I think we all wish he wouldn't lie so badly to us.

            Some other quick notes:
        </p>
        <img src="/nba2018/public/images/javalerejectedbyrim.jpg" class="image right"> </img>
        <label class="caption right"> JaVale McGee getting wide open for a dunk and then bringing it up straight into the rim represents all of us when we fail at something that seemed so easy. </label>
	    <ul id="list">
		    <li class="bullet-point"> Smith's end-of-game blunder rightfully got all the attention, but his end-of-half blunder shouldn't be forgotten. The Warriors were down three with only a few seconds left in the first half. With about three seconds left, Durant passes to Curry, who is just past half court. Smith inanely gambles for this pass, whiffing completely and giving Curry the opportunity to pull up for a wide-open 38-foot shot. Maybe for anyone else, this is okay. But Curry being Curry, he nailed this long three and the teams were tied at halftime. Golden State needed those points at the end of regulation. </li>
		    <li class="bullet-point"> Kerr played four of his vast array of centers: Jordan Bell, Kevan Looney, JaVale McGee and David West. Bell seemed like the best option, although Looney made things more difficult for LeBron than some other players on the Warriors do (Shaun Livingston may as well not exist when he matches up with James). McGee's entire six minute stint started at the beginning of the second half, during which he managed to score on easy baskets set up by Draymond Green, stonewall LeBron on a switch, and then be left completely alone under the basket, take some time to gather a pass, and promptly miss a dunk by getting rejected by the rim. It was an Extreme JaVale Experience in a tight little window. After his missed dunk, he was not seen again. </li>
		    <li class="bullet-point"> Kevin Durant wasn't particularly great, his 26 points coming on 22 shots. Too often he seemed content to settle for difficult turnaround jumpers from weird spots on the floor no matter who was guarding him. While it makes sense that he could make easy shots over George Hill or J.R. Smith, he seemed to make them more difficult than they needed to be by twisting and falling away. He had six assists, so he's not playing total Hero Ball out there, but the possessions that fall into 'Durant is going to do things and then shoot' are plentiful and not exactly efficient most games this postseason. </li>
	    </ul>
        <p>
            If Cleveland can generate the open looks they did in Game 1, and make a more reasonable amount of those open looks, then they can feel all right about Game 2. It remains to be seen if they can move on from this game from an emotional standpoint, but if they can and LeBron continues to be the demi-god he's been all postseason they can still steal this next game. The Warriors don't always bring their best effort when their backs aren't against the wall, and their backs aren't anywhere near the wall. As long as someone on the bench is constantly reminding J.R. Smith what the score is (this is what Kendrick Perkins is here for, right?) the Cavaliers have a chance.
