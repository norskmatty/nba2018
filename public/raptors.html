                Sometimes, you drink so much that you have a really bad hangover the next morning. Like, cancel your plans, stay in bed and vomit hungover. And you say that you'll never drink again. Of course, you will go back on this pledge. Just not the next day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, now pretend that instead of drinking too much, you lost to LeBron too much. That's where Raptors are at this season. They might have said, the day after they were swept by the Cavaliers, "We can never do this with this team again." But the offseason doesn't start the next day after a second round playoff loss. So they could very well go back on their pledge and enter next season with this same team. They did fire the coach, that counts as doing something, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                And that might not be a bad thing! There's a lot of talent here, from Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan to Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam. The Lowry/DeRozan/Valanciunas trio has won 56, 51 and 59 games the past three seasons and failed in the playoffs by losing convincingly to LeBron's Cavaliers in each season. And they haven't just lost, but they have been whupped up on. The whispers that started last season about how you can't win when DeRozan is your best player quieted during this season, as Toronto won more games than anyone outside of Houston. But then they went meekly down to what was LeBron's worst Cavs Part 2 team and the whispers weren't whispers anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                But blowing up the Raptors is hard. Could you trade Lowry, owed $64.3M the next two seasons, aged 32? DeRozan, owed $83.1M the next three seasons, aged 28? Serge Ibaka, owed $55M the next two seasons, aged 28? Or the ground-bound Jonas Valaciunas, only 25 but owed $34.1M the next two seasons and playing a position and style that few teams want even if they don't already have it? Even Norman Powell, the original VanVleet of this team (so much so he earned a nice contract as a backup player) and is now owed $41.9M over the next four years despite playing extremely sparingly in this year's playoffs?
            </p>
            <p>
                Does anyone outside of Toronto really want to take those contracts? I mean, maybe. DeRozan seems like a Knicks player, or Vlade Divac-bait for the Kings. They would do this. Ibaka has his moments of indecisiveness but he's much improved in that area and he can still provide meaningful minutes as the 5 in small lineups. Lowry can still play at a high level although his age and salary are pretty tough sells. Powell is on a decent contract, but I'm not sure you can get much for him, considering he took a step back. And trading Powell, who only played 15 minutes a game, isn't exactly 'blowing it up'.
            </p>
            <p>
                What if...they did nothing? I understand the feeling of wanting changes for a team that has continually flamed out in the playoffs. I do not think it would be easy for this group to look each other in the eyes next season and say, "This time it will be different." But it's not clear what they could or should do to get them to beat LeBron. And Boston and Philadelphia are talented and both could be even better next year. You might think you get tired of 50-win seasons that end in playoff heartbreak but I am here to tell you that 30-40 win seasons that end in reading NBA draft profiles is much less fun. Without getting better players than either Lowry or DeRozan, there isn't much the Raptors can really do to get meaningfully better.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing that could lead to a blow up, or at least a smaller, controlled explosion: the luxury tax. Toronto will pay it next season, and if they bring back Lucas Nogueira and VanVleet, they will pay a lot of it. To get under it, Toronto has to either trade one of Lowry, DeRozan, Ibaka or Valanciunas, or both Powell and C.J. Miles while taking less money in return. And then fill out the roster with minimum or barely above minimum contracts. That won't make them better but at least it will make them less inappropriately expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever Toronto does, they'll be killed for it. People are very invested in their opinions about what the Raptors should do. So they shouldn't let public opinion sway them. They should just know that they probably value their players higher than most other teams do, and that blowing up a perfectly good top-4 playoff team can lead a worse kind of purgatory: an 8-seed.
