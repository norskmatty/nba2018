            <p>
                After Gordan Hayward spurned Utah last offseason to sign up with the Celtics (you may have heard that Hayward played for Boston coach Brad Stevens in college), it would have been unsurprising if Utah took a step back after reaching the second round of the playoffs. They still had defensive stalwart Rudy Gobert and added Ricky Rubio, but without Hayward they had a huge hole at the 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or so they thought. The Jazz selected Donovan Mitchell by trading Trey Lyles to Denver in order to move up in last year's draft to #13 and ended up with one of the bigger steals in quite some time. At one point 19-28, the Jazz saw Mitchell transform into their best scorer and Gobert return from injury to run off a 30-6 finish to the season to vault into the Western Conference playoffs. Utah vastly outplayed the Oklahoma City Thunder, Russell Westbrook and Paul George be damned, before getting dusted by Houston.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mitchell developed into a star much quicker than anyone, maybe even the Jazz themselves, could have anticipated. And the Jazz with a healthy Gobert have one of the league's most difficult defensive challenges, as he protects the rim so well that other teams just flat-out refuse to even challenge him on dribble penetration. Utah now must build around Mitchell and Gobert. But if Utah is going to build on that, if they're going to get past the second round of the playoffs, then Mitchell is going to need some help on the offensive end beyond Joe Ingles three pointers and Rubio passes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If Mitchell is best as the primary ball-handler and scorer, then Rubio is not his greatest running-mate in the backcourt, although the pairing is not terrible. Rubio works well within Quin Snyder's motion offense, and he did improve his 3-point percentage to something passible this season (35.2% for the career 32% shooter on his highest volume ever) but Utah does still suffer from a lack of spacing for Mitchell's drives. The Jazz are full of players that can make a 3 (Derrick Favors, Royce O'Neale, Jae Crowder, Rubio) but not with demonstrated consistency other than Ingles. Gobert's offense is still basically limited to lobs, put-backs, and post moves that lack the skill of the upper-echelon players.
            </p>
            <p>
                Utah will have some cap space to work with this offseason if they choose to. Favors and Dante Exum are both free agents, and Utah has reasons to keep both and let both go. Lineups with Favors and Gobert together were a huge positive against the Thunder, but a gigantic negative against the much more modern Rockets. Exum has always shown flashes and is still just 22, but as someone whose best (and still maybe only) skill is getting to the rim he may not fit with this Utah team. To create still more space, Utah could also try to unload Alec Burks, but that might require giving up something else. Burks is almost good enough for what Utah needs, but he was dropped from the rotation for a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                The danger of letting Exum or Favors go is that they are talented players, and Utah is a net exporter of talented players. It's the nature of being a small-market team. It's tough for Utah to replace talented players beause talented players from other teams would usually rather sign somewhere else. So if you let one go for nothing, you'd better be damn sure you don't need them because you'll have to continually nail your draft picks to replace them. We don't need to talk about the potential of LeBron or George coming here, because they are assuredly not doing that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest need for Utah is definitely a secondary ball-handler that, unlike Rubio, can create a shot on his own. Something else they could use is a shooting big that can help stretch the floor more than, say, O'Neale or Crowder do when they play up to the 4. With Gobert anchoring the defense, they can get away with some defensive weaknesses and a small dip in overall defense would be worth potential strides made on the offensive end.
            </p>
            <p>
                If Utah can get a little bit better, if Mitchell can keep adding to his game, there's still something here even if it seemed like it was lost the moment Hayward went wayward. Judicious use of cap space is still the goal, and the Jazz won't 'win' the offseason with splashy moves. But they'll probably bet better than a lot of the teams that do next year.
