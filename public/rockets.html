                When Houston made the surprising move to acquire Chris Paul last offseason (surprising since it wasn't known that Paul would force his way out of Los Angeles), no one was sure if it would work out. And then Houston won 65 games and James Harden had an MVP season as Houston became the first NBA team ever to shoot more 3-pointers than 2-point shots. It worked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, for an encore, can Houston bring in LeBron James? It would require sacrifice from someone. If LeBron was to sign as a free agent, assuming Houston also wanted to keep Chris Paul, they would need to somehow trade Ryan Anderson ($42 million for the next two seasons, his ability to make deep 3's is valuable but not, like, THAT valuable) or (more likely) Eric Gordon and P.J. Tucker while also giving up all their cap holds for the non-Paul and Clint Capela players. Then the roster could be filled out with minimum contracts. The sacrifice is that in this scenario, LeBron and Paul can only split about $50-52 million.
            </p>
            <p>
                LeBron is probably not going to take that much less than the minimum, to say nothing of Chris Paul, who is eligible for a huge contract himself. The other scenario is a sacrifice from the Cavaliers, who would need to agree to trade James to Houston if LeBron made it clear he was going to leave. Just like Chris Paul did, LeBron could opt into his player option and make it a regular trade. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Both scenarios end up with a four-some of Harden, Paul, LeBron and Capela, plus probably Ryan Anderson (hard to see anyone taking him, especially Cleveland, for what will likely be bad first round picks coming from Houston) and Nene surrounded by ring-chasing veterans. That would probably work, and present a real challenge to the similarly stars-and-scrubs Golden State Warriors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, as fun as it to think about LeBron in Houston, what if he doesn't want to come there? Will San Antonio trade Kawhi Leonard to them? Could they convince Paul George to force his way over from Oklahoma City with his own opt-in player option? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tremendous nerd/GM Daryl Morey has been as skilled as anyone at pulling off big trades to remake his team. Nothing should be considered completely off the table, especially since superstars have to know that joining Harden and Paul would make for a real title contender. But adding a LeBron or a Leonard/George level player wouldn't be easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                While they technically have free cap space, it's only true if they denounce all their cap holds on their free agents. Even just Chris Paul will more than eat up more than the currently available cap space, to say nothing of Trevor Ariza and Capela. If they did somehow trade Ryan Anderson (would two firsts work? Would Houston do that just to get rid of Anderson?) they could build more conventionally around the tandem of Harden and Paul. They were a great team with this team as currently constructed, if they just made further improvements on the margins it could be enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                But for real, go for broke, Houston. Harden's 28. Paul is 32. Capela is the only other player under the age of 29 the played any meaningful minutes. Time is not on Houston's side. I don't need to tell Morey this, though. I'm sure he's already thought about how he's going to make this team even better with his nerd spreadsheets and all that.
