                When Houston made the surprising move to acquire Chris Paul last offseason (surprising since it wasn't known that Paul would force his way out of Los Angeles), no one was sure if it would work out. And then Houston won 65 games and James Harden had an MVP season as Houston became the first NBA team ever to shoot more 3-pointers than 2-point shots. It worked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, for an encore, can Houston bring in LeBron James? It would require sacrifice from someone. If LeBron was to sign as a free agent, assuming Houston also wanted to keep Chris Paul, they would need to somehow trade Ryan Anderson ($42 million for the next two seasons, his ability to make deep 3's is valuable but not, like, THAT valuable) or (more likely) Eric Gordon and P.J. Tucker while also giving up all their cap holds for all the non-Clint Capela players. By the way, Capela needs to stay in this scenario because he's become too good to give up, especially if Houston wants to retain the uber-switching defense that served them well. Then the roster could be filled out with minimum contracts. The sacrifice is that in this scenario, LeBron and Paul can only split about $50-52 million. LeBron could also opt-in to his player option and force a trade, even if Cleveland would rather not do that.          
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, as fun as it to think about LeBron in Houston, what if he doesn't want to come there? In the much more likely scenario, which player can they add for the MLE that will help them, and will ownership sign off on the tax bill(s) that are coming? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tremendous nerd/GM Daryl Morey has been as skilled as anyone at pulling off big trades to remake his team. Nothing should be considered completely off the table, especially since superstars have to know that joining Harden and Paul would make for a real title contender. This team was maybe a Paul injury away from winning the title. But adding a LeBron or a Leonard/George level player wouldn't be easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                While they technically have free cap space, it's only true if they denounce all their cap holds on their free agents. Even just Chris Paul will more than eat up more than the currently available cap space, to say nothing of Trevor Ariza and Capela. If they did somehow trade Ryan Anderson (would two firsts work? Would Houston do that just to get rid of Anderson?) they could build more conventionally around the tandem of Harden and Paul. They were a great team with this team as currently constructed, if they just made further improvements on the margins it could be enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it's likely that Houston will want to retain all of Paul, Ariza and Capela, this team is going to be extremely expensive, and one really good question is how long does Houston want to retain Paul, Ariza and Capela. Chris Paul can be paid up to $205 million over 5 years (average of $41M per season, starting at $35.5M in 2018-19). But with Paul 32, that would easily be a disasterous deal for Houston, maybe as soon as the second year of the deal. Giving Paul the max but over a shorter time span wouldn't be ideal, either, but at least a better compromise for the Rockets. Meanwhile, Ariza is a very important part of Houston's best five but also extremely intriguing to basically every other team in the league as a very capable 3-and-D wing. Houston won't need to pay Ariza the max or anything close to that, but may need to at least meet the MLE ($8.5M, roughly) that other over-the-cap contenders could offer. As for Capela, he's going to need a raise after having a great season and playoffs. He's restricted, so Houston can meet any offer, but are going to need to go in the $15M per year range at least to keep him and keep him content with his deal. 
            </p>		
            <p>
                Harden's 28. Paul is 32. Capela is the only other player under the age of 29 that played any meaningful minutes. Time is not on Houston's side. I don't need to tell Morey this, though. I'm sure he's already thought about how he's going to make this team even better with his nerd spreadsheets and all that.
