                Looking at Phoenix is like looking at what the Process is without several, or any, picks higher than #4. They're terrible, and while they have some still interesting players they aren't exactly about to roll out anything like the Ben Simmons/Joel Embiid combo that terrorized the league this past season. They are still firmly in the weeds, hoping that another year of tanking will produce the 1st overall pick, finally, and that the players they've drafted the past few years grow into a contender.
            </p>
            <p>
               Well, they finally got that first overall pick! Now they can choose between Deandre Ayton, an athletic center with a decent jump shot, and Luka Doncic, a point guard wunderkind whose playmaking would theoretically pair well with Devin Booker. That sounds pretty good! Booker would then be the unquestioned scoring guard and Josh Jackson needs to grow into a wing defender/second option. Jackson took some steps forward toward the end of last season after a brutal start. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If a wing player is taken either 1st or 16th (the Suns have that pick via Miami from the Goran Dragic trade), it might eventually crowd out T.J. Warren, but that's probably for the best. Warren might not be capable of scoring efficiently enough or playing defense at the 3/4 well enough to justify a starting role on a good team.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a guard gets drafted, and the Suns re-sign Elfrid Payton, then something might need to be done about Brandon Knight, who missed all of last season with a torn ACL. Payton was acquired for a second round pick and played only 19 games with Phoenix, but they still shouldn't be in a huge hurry to re-sign him. Payton is an atrocious shooter who can hurt an offense without the ball simply because it's too easy to help off of him. If Doncic is drafted, Payton would project as nothing more than a backup with little sizzle to his game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss were both acquired in the 2016 draft and both still have a long way to go to being productive players on a winning team. They both still start the season under the age of 21 despite two full NBA seasons under their belts, so no one should quit on them quite yet. Bender flashed more of a 3 point shot, but continues to be a weak defender who rebounds badly for his size. Chriss still fouls too much (although his foul totals did drop a bit from last year's mark) and doesn't offer much on offense still.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tyson Chandler and Jared Dudley, the only players over the age of 26 on the team, each have one more year to spend toiling for a losing team. Perhaps they could be traded at some point for a weak asset, with Dudley potentially actually having some value for a contender while Chandler unfortunately is likely only interesting if a team wants a big expiring contract. Neither is getting in the way of Phoenix signing a free agent, they still have cap space and free agents aren't exactly lining up to join a team that still hasn't shifted out of 'TANK'. 
            </p>

                Chandler and Unrestricted Free Agent Alex Len would be all that stands between Ayton if Phoenix decided he can be a modern, switch capable center and draft him first overall. That is to say, there's nothing standing in the way of plenty of early playing time for Ayton.

                The Phoenix plan is still to go into next season with some promising young players, some still intriguing young players and some young players for whom the bloom is coming off the rose. They will once again throw it all against the wall along with a few more draft picks and continue to see what sticks. Are players on the next great Suns team on the roster already? I hope so, otherwise they are wasting a lot of time.
