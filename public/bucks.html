                Milwaukee came into the season with a fair amount of excitement. Giannis took another step toward superstardom, and they added Eric Bledsoe early in the season to shore up their point guard position, and there were big expectations for them. And, of course, they failed to meet them, limping into the playoffs as a 7-seed and then being dismissed in 7 games by the Kyrie-less Celtics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite their overall length and athleticism, the Bucks were all too frequently a disorganized mess on defense. This was only made worse with the return of Jabari Parker, who for all of his offensive gifts at times looked almost statuesque on defense. Ending the season with just Tyler Zeller and John Henson at the center position, the Bucks lack of rim protection was as much a problem as their organizational woes. Bledsoe was not quite the player the Bucks hoped he would be, Khris Middleton took a step back as a shooter, and Thon Maker apparently can only be effective in short playoff spurts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They'll have a new coach after Jason Kidd was fired midseason and interim coach Joe Prunty did little to show he should keep the job beyond the end of the season. Hopefully that new coach can drive internal improvements from this team with a better defensive system, because there appears little Milwaukee can do at the moment to upgrade the roster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things may well open up after this season, however. Bledsoe will be a free agent in 2019 and will want more than the current $15M on his last year. Brogdon is as well (RFA) and will probably command at least a mid-tier salary. Khris Middleton has a $13M player option that he may decline in order to get a new multi-year deal. Matthew Dellevadova, Tony Snell and Henson will all be in the last years of their deals. If the Bucks don't improve this season, they could go all-in on a blow-up of the team around Giannis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming back to this season, the biggest decision for Milwaukee is what to do about Jabari Parker. Coming back from a second ACL tear in his left knee, Parker was not 100% in the 31 regular season and 7 playoff games he played upon his return. With a healthy offseason to work back into shape, he could make it back to the levels he played at before that second injury. But it doesn't appear he'll be anything other than a net negative on defense, and with two major knee issues his potential in the future is cloudy. It's possible the Parker could be one of the most sought-after RFAs this offseason, with teams willing to live with the defense and chance his health in order to get his prodigious offensive potential. The Bucks can, of course, match any deal, but if that deal is for $20M+ a season, they might have to pass.
            </p>

                Re-signing Parker at that level puts them in danger of flying close to the tax line this season, something they would certainly have trouble avoiding if they wanted to re-sign Brogdon, Bledsoe and Middleton next offseason. Something will have to give there, so if Parker returns count on at least one of those players leaving after the season.

                If they don't bring back Parker, they could instead bring back the cheaper Shabazz Muhammad or a similar offensive-type player for a bench role. Their ideal lineup should, potentially, be strong enough to show better than it did last year. But it simply hasn't yet. A new coach will either get it to do so, or the Bucks will be much busier next offseason than they will this one.
