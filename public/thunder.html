                Sometimes, you put a super team together and it works out. LeBron, Wade and Bosh. Curry, Klay, Dray and Durant. But sometimes you try to put a super team together and it ends up like a 'Chopped' dish: it's fine given the ingredients, but the ingredients were never really going to be put together in a truly tremendous way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Thunder were the 'Chopped' dish. After Russell Westbrook spent a year fulfilling the secret wish of every basketball player by being a one-man wrecking crew following the loss of Kevin Durant, the Thunder came back with what they hoped was a vengeance. Gone were Domantas Sabonis, Victor Oladipo and Enes Kanter. In their place: Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. The name value was high, Westbrook had two stars to work with along with the crucial Steven Adams and Andre Roberson to handle the defensive wing work. It looked like Oklahoma City was going to make a serious run in the difficult Western Conference. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It didn't happen like that. The team struggled out of the gate, including losing their first six straight games that came down to the final two minutes (games where no team led by more than five). They ended up the four seed, but were dusted by a Utah Jazz team led by a rookie. Westbrook averaged his second straight season triple double, but wasn't quite as efficient. Paul George was fine, but struggled in the playoffs despite his self-proclaimed nickname "Playoff P". Andre Roberson was lost for the year and the Thunder defense never was the same. But Carmelo Anthony was definitely the weak link on the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Age caught up to Melo this year and his weaknesses, especially on defense, were magnified in the playoffs. Good thing he's only owed $28 million more next year! Anthony even used his exit interview to suggest he didn't like his role and wouldn't be interested in going to the bench, although it's unclear how reducing his role further wouldn't be to the absolute benefit of the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest question that Oklahoma City needs answered is one they have no control over: Will George stick around? He has a player option for the next season, and but the Thunder would rather he sign an extension instead. They can offer a better extension than anyone because they have his Bird rights, including a fifth year at massive money that no other team can offer. The good news for OKC is that if he leaves, they could probably avoid the luxury tax. The bad news would be that they have little left available to replace him in any fashion if he does leave, and even if he signs a max extensions and stays they would so far into the tax they would be hard pressed to further improve the team, or even keep it at the level it's at now (stretching Melo and re-signing Jerami Grant would potentially come close to canceling each other out).
            </p>
            <p>
                They can't trade a first round pick that would be due before 2022, unless someone is willing to accept their 1-20 selection in 2020. None of their non-George players have much particular value beyond Westbrook and Adams, neither of whom they would want to trade if the intention is to improve the team. They swung for the fences acquiring George, and if he leaves they're in a pretty bad place. Even if George comes back, this is a very expensive team that doesn't give management much hope that it will be worth paying exorbiant luxury taxes for (it's pretty rich that Oklahoma City is paying luxury tax payments to teams like, for example, the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks). 
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't put any trade wizardry past Sam Presti, but at some point you run out of assets to trade and they may be close to that point. Assuming Carmelo Anthony doesn't hate Oklahoma City so much he declines his option despite the very real possibility it costs him millions of dollars, the best case for Oklahoma City is that George comes back and this same cast of characters somehow makes it work in Year 2 while the price of oil skyrockets so that ownership can afford the luxury tax bill.
